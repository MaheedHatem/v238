title: Discriminant Distance-Aware Representation on Deterministic Uncertainty Quantification
  Methods
abstract: Uncertainty estimation is a crucial aspect of deploying dependable deep
  learning models in safety-critical systems. In this study, we introduce a novel
  and efficient method for deterministic uncertainty estimation called Discriminant
  Distance-Awareness Representation (DDAR). Our approach involves constructing a DNN
  model that incorporates a set of prototypes in its latent representations, enabling
  us to analyze valuable feature information from the input data. By leveraging a
  distinction maximization layer over optimal trainable prototypes, DDAR can learn
  a discriminant distance-awareness representation. We demonstrate that DDAR overcomes
  feature collapse by relaxing the Lipschitz constraint that hinders the practicality
  of deterministic uncertainty methods (DUMs) architectures. Our experiments show
  that DDAR is a flexible and architecture-agnostic method that can be easily integrated
  as a pluggable layer with distance-sensitive metrics, outperforming state-of-the-art
  uncertainty estimation methods on multiple benchmark problems.
