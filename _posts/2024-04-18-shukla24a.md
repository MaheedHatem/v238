title: 'DiffRed: Dimensionality reduction guided by stable rank'
software: https://github.com/S3-Lab-IIT/DiffRed/tree/master
abstract: In this work, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction technique, \textit{DiffRed},
  which first projects the data matrix, A, along first $k_1$ principal components
  and the residual matrix $A^{*}$ (left after subtracting its $k_1$-rank approximation)
  along $k_2$ Gaussian random vectors. We evaluate \emph{M1}, the distortion of mean-squared
  pair-wise distance, and \emph{Stress}, the normalized value of RMS of distortion
  of the pairwise distances. We rigorously prove that \textit{DiffRed} achieves a
  general upper bound of $O\left(\sqrt{\frac{1-p}{k_2}}\right)$ on \emph{Stress} and
  $O\left(\frac{1-p}{\sqrt{k_2*\rho(A^{*})}}\right)$ on \emph{M1} where $p$ is the
  fraction of variance explained by the first $k_1$ principal components and $\rho(A^{*})$
  is the \textit{stable rank} of $A^{*}$. These bounds are tighter than the currently
  known results for Random maps. Our extensive experiments on a variety of real-world
  datasets demonstrate that \textit{DiffRed} achieves near zero \emph{M1} and much
  lower values of \emph{Stress} as compared to the well-known dimensionality reduction
  techniques. In particular, \textit{DiffRed} can map a 6 million dimensional dataset
  to 10 dimensions with 54% lower \emph{Stress} than PCA.
