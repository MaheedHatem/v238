title: Safe and Interpretable Estimation of Optimal Treatment Regimes
software: https://github.com/almost-matching-exactly/opt_tx_regime_matching
abstract: Recent advancements in statistical and reinforcement learning methods have
  contributed to superior patient care strategies. However, these methods face substantial
  challenges in high-stakes contexts, including missing data, stochasticity, and the
  need for interpretability and patient safety. Our work operationalizes a safe and
  interpretable approach for optimizing treatment regimes by matching patients with
  similar medical and pharmacological profiles. This allows us to construct optimal
  policies via interpolation. Our comprehensive simulation study demonstrates our
  methodâ€™s effectiveness in complex scenarios. We use this approach to study seizure
  treatment in critically ill patients, advocating for personalized strategies based
  on medical history and pharmacological features. Our findings recommend reducing
  medication doses for mild, brief seizure episodes and adopting aggressive treatment
  strategies for severe cases, leading to improved outcomes.
