title: Strategic Usage in a Multi-Learner Setting
software: https://github.com/eliotshekhtman/strategic-usage
abstract: Real-world systems often involve some pool of users choosing between a set
  of services. With the increase in popularity of online learning algorithms, these
  services can now self-optimize, leveraging data collected on users to maximize some
  reward such as service quality. On the flipside, users may strategically choose
  which services to use in order to pursue their own reward functions, in the process
  wielding power over which services can see and use their data. Extensive prior research
  has been conducted on the effects of strategic users in single-service settings,
  with strategic behavior manifesting in the manipulation of observable features to
  achieve a desired classification; however, this can often be costly or unattainable
  for users and fails to capture the full behavior of multi-service dynamic systems.
  As such, we analyze a setting in which strategic users choose among several available
  services in order to pursue positive classifications, while services seek to minimize
  loss functions on their observations. We focus our analysis on realizable settings,
  and show that naive retraining can still lead to oscillation even if all users are
  observed at different times; however, if this retraining uses memory of past observations,
  convergent behavior can be guaranteed for certain loss function classes. We provide
  results obtained from synthetic and real-world data to empirically validate our
  theoretical findings.
