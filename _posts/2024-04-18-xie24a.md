title: Distributionally Robust Quickest Change Detection using Wasserstein Uncertainty
  Sets
abstract: The problem of quickest detection of a change in the distribution of streaming
  data is considered. It is assumed that the pre-change distribution is known, while
  the only information about the post-change is through a (small) set of labeled data.
  This post-change data is used in a data-driven minimax robust framework, where an
  uncertainty set for the post-change distribution is constructed. The robust change
  detection problem is studied in an asymptotic setting where the mean time to false
  alarm goes to infinity. It is shown that the least favorable distribution (LFD)
  is an exponentially tilted version of the pre-change density and can be obtained
  efficiently. A Cumulative Sum (CuSum) test based on the LFD, which is referred to
  as the distributionally robust (DR) CuSum test, is then shown to be asymptotically
  robust. The results are extended to the case with multiple post-change uncertainty
  sets and validated using synthetic and real data examples.
