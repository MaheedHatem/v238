title: The sample complexity of ERMs in stochastic convex optimization
abstract: 'Stochastic convex optimization is one of the most well-studied models for
  learning in modern machine learning. Nevertheless, a central fundamental question
  in this setup remained unresolved: how many data points must be observed so that
  any empirical risk minimizer (ERM) shows good performance on the true population?
  This question was proposed by Feldman who proved that $\Omega(\frac{d}{\epsilon}
  + \frac{1}{\epsilon^2} )$ data points are necessary (where $d$ is the dimension
  and $\epsilon > 0$ the accuracy parameter). Proving an $\omega(\frac{d}{\epsilon}
  + \frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ lower bound was left as an open problem. In this work we
  show that in fact $\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{\epsilon} + \frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ data points
  are also sufficient. This settles the question and yields a new separation between
  ERMs and uniform convergence. This sample complexity holds for the classical setup
  of learning bounded convex Lipschitz functions over the Euclidean unit ball. We
  further generalize the result and show that a similar upper bound holds for all
  symmetric convex bodies. The general bound is composed of two terms: (i) a term
  of the form $\tilde{O}(\frac{d}{\epsilon})$ with an inverse-linear dependence on
  the accuracy parameter, and (ii) a term that depends on the statistical complexity
  of the class of linear functions (captured by the Rademacher complexity). The proof
  builds a mechanism for controlling the behavior of stochastic convex optimization
  problems.'
