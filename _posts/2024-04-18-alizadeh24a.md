title: Pessimistic Off-Policy Multi-Objective Optimization
abstract: Multi-objective optimization is a class of optimization problems with multiple
  conflicting objectives. We study offline optimization of multi-objective policies
  from data collected by a previously deployed policy. We propose a pessimistic estimator
  for policy values that can be easily plugged into existing formulas for hypervolume
  computation and optimized. The estimator is based on inverse propensity scores (IPS),
  and improves upon a naive IPS estimator in both theory and experiments. Our analysis
  is general, and applies beyond our IPS estimators and methods for optimizing them.
