title: Data-Driven Online Model Selection With Regret Guarantees
abstract: We consider model selection for sequential decision making in stochastic
  environments with bandit feedback, where a meta-learner has at its disposal a pool
  of base learners, and decides on the fly which action to take based on the policies
  recommended by each base learner. Model selection is performed by regret balancing
  but, unlike the recent literature on this subject, we do not assume any prior knowledge
  about the base learners like candidate regret guarantees; instead, we uncover these
  quantities in a data-driven manner. The meta-learner is therefore able to leverage
  the *realized* regret incurred by each base learner for the learning environment
  at hand (as opposed to the *expected* regret), and single out the best such regret.
  We design two model selection algorithms operating with this more ambitious notion
  of regret and, besides proving model selection guarantees via regret balancing,
  we experimentally demonstrate the compelling practical benefits of dealing with
  actual regrets instead of candidate regret bounds.
