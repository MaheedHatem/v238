title: Accelerating Approximate Thompson Sampling with Underdamped Langevin Monte
  Carlo
software: https://github.com/haoyangzheng1996/ts_ulmc
abstract: Approximate Thompson sampling with Langevin Monte Carlo broadens its reach
  from Gaussian posterior sampling to encompass more general smooth posteriors. However,
  it still encounters scalability issues in high-dimensional problems when demanding
  high accuracy. To address this, we propose an approximate Thompson sampling strategy,
  utilizing underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, where the latter is the go-to workhorse
  for simulations of high-dimensional posteriors. Based on the standard smoothness
  and log-concavity conditions, we study the accelerated posterior concentration and
  sampling using a specific potential function. This design improves the sample complexity
  for realizing logarithmic regrets from $\mathcal{\tilde O}(d)$ to $\mathcal{\tilde
  O}(\sqrt{d})$. The scalability and robustness of our algorithm are also empirically
  validated through synthetic experiments in high-dimensional bandit problems.
