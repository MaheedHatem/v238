title: Functional Flow Matching
software: https://github.com/GavinKerrigan/functional_flow_matching
abstract: We propose Functional Flow Matching (FFM), a function-space generative model
  that generalizes the recently-introduced Flow Matching model to operate directly
  in infinite-dimensional spaces. Our approach works by first defining a path of probability
  measures that interpolates between a fixed Gaussian measure and the data distribution,
  followed by learning a vector field on the underlying space of functions that generates
  this path of measures. Our method does not rely on likelihoods or simulations, making
  it well-suited to the function space setting. We provide both a theoretical framework
  for building such models and an empirical evaluation of our techniques. We demonstrate
  through experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that our proposed FFM
  method outperforms several recently proposed function-space generative models.
