title: Scalable Higher-Order Tensor Product Spline Models
abstract: In the current era of vast data and transparent machine learning, it is
  essential for techniques to operate at a large scale while providing a clear mathematical
  comprehension of the internal workings of the method. Although there already exist
  interpretable semi-parametric regression methods for large-scale applications that
  take into account non-linearity in the data, the complexity of the models is still
  often limited. One of the main challenges is the absence of interactions in these
  models, which are left out for the sake of better interpretability but also due
  to impractical computational costs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new
  approach using a factorization method to derive a highly scalable higher-order tensor
  product spline model. Our method allows for the incorporation of all (higher-order)
  interactions of non-linear feature effects while having computational costs proportional
  to a model without interactions. We further develop a meaningful penalization scheme
  and examine the induced optimization problem. We conclude by evaluating the predictive
  and estimation performance of our method.
