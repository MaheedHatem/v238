title: Faithful graphical representations of local independence
software: https://github.com/soerenwengel/faithfulLIGsCode
abstract: Graphical models use graphs to represent conditional independence structure
  in the distribution of a random vector. In stochastic processes, graphs may represent
  so-called local independence or conditional Granger causality. Under some regularity
  conditions, a local independence graph implies a set of independences using a graphical
  criterion known as delta-separation, or using its generalization, mu-separation.
  This is a stochastic process analogue of d-separation in DAGs. However, there may
  be more independences than implied by this graph and this is a violation of so-called
  faithfulness. We characterize faithfulness in local independence graphs and give
  a method to construct a faithful graph from any local independence model such that
  the output equals the true graph when Markov and faithfulness assumptions hold.
  We discuss various assumptions that are weaker than faithfulness, and we explore
  different structure learning algorithms and their properties under varying assumptions.
