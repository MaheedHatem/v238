title: The Risks of Recourse in Binary Classification
software: https://github.com/HiddeFok/consequences-of-recourse
abstract: Algorithmic recourse provides explanations that help users overturn an unfavorable
  decision by a machine learning system. But so far very little attention has been
  paid to whether providing recourse is beneficial or not. We introduce an abstract
  learning-theoretic framework that compares the risks (i.e., expected losses) for
  classification with and without algorithmic recourse. This allows us to answer the
  question of when providing recourse is beneficial or harmful at the population level.
  Surprisingly, we find that there are many plausible scenarios in which providing
  recourse turns out to be harmful, because it pushes users to regions of higher class
  uncertainty and therefore leads to more mistakes. We further study whether the party
  deploying the classifier has an incentive to strategize in anticipation of having
  to provide recourse, and we find that sometimes they do, to the detriment of their
  users. Providing algorithmic recourse may therefore also be harmful at the systemic
  level. We confirm our theoretical findings in experiments on simulated and real-world
  data. All in all, we conclude that the current concept of algorithmic recourse is
  not reliably beneficial, and therefore requires rethinking.
