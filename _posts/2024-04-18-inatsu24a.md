title: Bounding Box-based Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization of Risk Measures under
  Input Uncertainty
software: https://github.com/takeuchi-lab/Bounding-Box-Based-MOBO
abstract: In this study, we propose a novel multi-objective Bayesian optimization
  (MOBO) method to efficiently identify the Pareto front (PF) defined by risk measures
  for black-box functions under the presence of input uncertainty (IU). Existing BO
  methods for Pareto optimization in the presence of IU are risk-specific or without
  theoretical guarantees, whereas our proposed method addresses general risk measures
  and has theoretical guarantees. The basic idea of the proposed method is to assume
  a Gaussian process (GP) model for the black-box function and to construct high-probability
  bounding boxes for the risk measures using the GP model. Furthermore, in order to
  reduce the uncertainty of non-dominated bounding boxes, we propose a method of selecting
  the next evaluation point using a maximin distance defined by the maximum value
  of a quasi distance based on bounding boxes. As theoretical analysis, we prove that
  the algorithm can return an arbitrary-accurate solution in a finite number of iterations
  with high probability, for various risk measures such as Bayes risk, worst-case
  risk, and value-at-risk. We also give a theoretical analysis that takes into account
  approximation errors because there exist non-negligible approximation errors (e.g.,
  finite approximation of PFs and sampling-based approximation of bounding boxes)
  in practice. We confirm that the proposed method performs as well or better than
  existing methods not only in the setting with IU but also in the setting of ordinary
  MOBO through numerical experiments.
