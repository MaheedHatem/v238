title: Fixed-Budget Real-Valued Combinatorial Pure Exploration of Multi-Armed Bandit
software: https://github.com/ShintaroNakamuraUT/FixedBudgetR-CPE-MAB
abstract: We study the real-valued combinatorial pure exploration of the multi-armed
  bandit in the fixed-budget setting. We first introduce an algorithm named the Combinatorial
  Successive Asign (CSA) algorithm, which is the first algorithm that can identify
  the best action even when the size of the action class is exponentially large with
  respect to the number of arms. We show that the upper bound of the probability of
  error of the CSA algorithm matches a lower bound up to a logarithmic factor in the
  exponent. Then, we introduce another algorithm named the Minimax Combinatorial Successive
  Accepts and Rejects (Minimax-CombSAR) algorithm for the case where the size of the
  action class is polynomial, and show that it is optimal, which matches a lower bound.
  Finally, we experimentally compare the algorithms with previous methods and show
  that our algorithm performs better.
