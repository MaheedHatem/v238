title: 'SDMTR: A Brain-inspired Transformer for Relation Inference'
software: https://github.com/zengxyyu/SDMTR.git
abstract: Deep learning has seen a movement towards the concepts of modularity, module
  coordination and sparse interactions to fit the working principles of biological
  systems. Inspired by Global Workspace Theory and long-term memory system in human
  brain, both are instrumental in constructing biologically plausible artificial intelligence
  systems, we introduce the shared dual-memory Transformers (SDMTR)â€” a model that
  builds upon Transformers. The proposed approach includes the shared long-term memory
  and workspace with finite capacity in which different specialized modules compete
  to write information. Later, crucial information from shared workspace is inscribed
  into long-term memory through outer product attention mechanism to reduce information
  conflict and build a knowledge reservoir, thereby facilitating subsequent inference,
  learning and problem-solving. We apply SDMTR to multi-modality question-answering
  and reasoning challenges, including text-based bAbI-20k, visual Sort-of-CLEVR and
  triangle relations detection tasks. The results demonstrate that our SDMTR significantly
  outperforms the vanilla Transformer and its recent improvements. Additionally, visualization
  analyses indicate that the presence of memory positively correlates with model effectiveness
  on inference tasks. This research provides novel insights and empirical support
  to advance biologically plausible deep learning frameworks.
