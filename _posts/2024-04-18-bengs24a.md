title: Identifying Copeland Winners in Dueling Bandits with Indifferences
software: https://github.com/bengsV/COWI_Ident
abstract: We consider the task of identifying the Copeland winner(s) in a dueling
  bandits problem with ternary feedback. This is an underexplored but practically
  relevant variant of the conventional dueling bandits problem, in which, in addition
  to strict preference between two arms, one may observe feedback in the form of an
  indifference. We provide a lower bound on the sample complexity for any learning
  algorithm finding the Copeland winner(s) with a fixed error probability. Moreover,
  we propose POCOWISTA, an algorithm with a sample complexity that almost matches
  this lower bound, and which shows excellent empirical performance, even for the
  conventional dueling bandits problem. For the case where the preference probabilities
  satisfy a specific type of stochastic transitivity, we provide a refined version
  with an improved worst case sample complexity.
