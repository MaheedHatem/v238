title: Hodge-Compositional Edge Gaussian Processes
software: https://github.com/cookbook-ms/Hodge-Edge-GP
abstract: We propose principled Gaussian processes (GPs) for modeling functions defined
  over the edge set of a simplicial 2-complex, a structure similar to a graph in which
  edges may form triangular faces. This approach is intended for learning flow-type
  data on networks where edge flows can be characterized by the discrete divergence
  and curl. Drawing upon the Hodge decomposition, we first develop classes of divergence-free
  and curl-free edge GPs, suitable for various applications. We then combine them
  to create Hodge-compositional edge GPs that are expressive enough to represent any
  edge function. These GPs facilitate direct and independent learning for the different
  Hodge components of edge functions, enabling us to capture their relevance during
  hyperparameter optimization. To highlight their practical potential, we apply them
  for flow data inference in currency exchange, ocean currents and water supply networks,
  comparing them to alternative models.
