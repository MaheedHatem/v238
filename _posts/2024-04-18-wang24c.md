title: Joint control variate for faster black-box variational inference
software: https://github.com/xidulu/JointCV
abstract: 'Black-box variational inference performance is sometimes hindered by the
  use of gradient estimators with high variance. This variance comes from two sources
  of randomness: Data subsampling and Monte Carlo sampling. While existing control
  variates only address Monte Carlo noise, and incremental gradient methods typically
  only address data subsampling, we propose a new "joint" control variate that jointly
  reduces variance from both sources of noise. This significantly reduces gradient
  variance, leading to faster optimization in several applications.'
