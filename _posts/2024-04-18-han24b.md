title: Conformalized Semi-supervised Random Forest for Classification and Abnormality
  Detection
software: https://github.com/yujinhan98/CSForest
abstract: The Random Forests classifier, a widely utilized off-the-shelf classification
  tool, assumes training and test samples come from the same distribution as other
  standard classifiers. However, in safety-critical scenarios like medical diagnosis
  and network attack detection, discrepancies between the training and test sets,
  including the potential presence of novel outlier samples not appearing during training,
  can pose significant challenges. To address this problem, we introduce the Conformalized
  Semi-Supervised Random Forest (CSForest), which couples the conformalization technique
  Jackknife+aB with semi-supervised tree ensembles to construct a set-valued prediction
  $C(x)$. Instead of optimizing over the training distribution, CSForest employs unlabeled
  test samples to enhance accuracy and flag unseen outliers by generating an empty
  set. Theoretically, we establish CSForest to cover true labels for previously observed
  inlier classes under arbitrarily label-shift in the test data. We compare CSForest
  with state-of-the-art methods using synthetic examples and various real-world datasets,
  under different types of distribution changes in the test domain. Our results highlight
  CSForestâ€™s effective prediction of inliers and its ability to detect outlier samples
  unique to the test data. In addition, CSForest shows persistently good performance
  as the sizes of the training and test sets vary. Codes of CSForest are available
  at https://github.com/yujinhan98/CSForest.
