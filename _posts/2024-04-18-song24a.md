title: Solving Attention Kernel Regression Problem via Pre-conditioner
abstract: 'Attention mechanism is the key to large language models, and attention
  matrix serves as an algorithmic and computational bottleneck for such a scheme.
  In this paper, we define two problems, motivated by designing fast algorithms for
  \emph{proxy} of attention matrix and solving regressions against them. Given an
  input matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ with $n\gg d$ and a response vector $b$,
  we first consider the matrix exponential of the matrix $A^\top A$ as a proxy, and
  we in turn design algorithms for two types of regression problems: $\min_{x\in \mathbb{R}^d}\|(A^\top
  A)^jx-b\|_2$ and $\min_{x\in \mathbb{R}^d}\|A(A^\top A)^jx-b\|_2$ for any positive
  integer $j$. Studying algorithms for these regressions is essential, as matrix exponential
  can be approximated term-by-term via these smaller problems. The second proxy is
  applying exponential entrywise to the Gram matrix, denoted by $\exp(AA^\top)$ and
  solving the regression $\min_{x\in \mathbb{R}^n}\|\exp(AA^\top)x-b \|_2$. We call
  this problem the \emph{attention kernel regression} problem, as the matrix $\exp(AA^\top)$
  could be viewed as a kernel function with respect to $A$. We design fast algorithms
  for these regression problems, based on sketching and preconditioning. We hope these
  efforts will provide an alternative perspective of studying efficient approximation
  of attention matrices.'
