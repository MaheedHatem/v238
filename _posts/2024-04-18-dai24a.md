title: Local Causal Discovery with Linear non-Gaussian Cyclic Models
abstract: Local causal discovery is of great practical significance, as there are
  often situations where the discovery of the global causal structure is unnecessary,
  and the interest lies solely on a single target variable. Most existing local methods
  utilize conditional independence relations, providing only a partially directed
  graph, and assume acyclicity for the ground-truth structure, even though real-world
  scenarios often involve cycles like feedback mechanisms. In this work, we present
  a general, unified local causal discovery method with linear non-Gaussian models,
  whether they are cyclic or acyclic. We extend the application of independent component
  analysis from the global context to independent subspace analysis, enabling the
  exact identification of the equivalent local directed structures and causal strengths
  from the Markov blanket of the target variable. We also propose an alternative regression-based
  method in the particular acyclic scenarios. Our identifiability results are empirically
  validated using both synthetic and real-world datasets.
