title: "Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization for Preprocessing Time Series
  Data for Neural Networks"
software: " https://github.com/marcusGH/edain_paper"
abstract: " Data preprocessing is a crucial part of any machine learning pipeline,
  and it can have a significant impact on both performance and training efficiency.
  This is especially evident when using deep neural networks for time series prediction
  and classification: real-world time series data often exhibit irregularities such
  as multi-modality, skewness and outliers, and the model performance can degrade
  rapidly if these characteristics are not adequately addressed. In this work, we
  propose the EDAIN (Extended Deep Adaptive Input Normalization) layer, a novel adaptive
  neural layer that learns how to appropriately normalize irregular time series data
  for a given task in an end-to-end fashion, instead of using a fixed normalization
  scheme. This is achieved by optimizing its unknown parameters simultaneously with
  the deep neural network using back-propagation. Our experiments, conducted using
  synthetic data, a credit default prediction dataset, and a large-scale limit order
  book benchmark dataset, demonstrate the superior performance of the EDAIN layer
  when compared to conventional normalization methods and existing adaptive time series
  preprocessing layers. "
