title: Multi-Domain Causal Representation Learning via Weak Distributional Invariances
software: https://github.com/facebookresearch/MD-CRL
abstract: 'Causal representation learning has emerged as the center of action in causal
  machine learning research. In particular, multi-domain datasets present a natural
  opportunity for showcasing the advantages of causal representation learning over
  standard unsupervised representation learning. While recent works have taken crucial
  steps towards learning causal representations, they often lack applicability to
  multi-domain datasets due to over-simplifying assumptions about the data; e.g. each
  domain comes from a different single-node perfect intervention. In this work, we
  relax these assumptions and capitalize on the following observation: there often
  exists a subset of latents whose certain distributional properties (e.g., support,
  variance) remain stable across domains; this property holds when, for example, each
  domain comes from a multi-node imperfect intervention. Leveraging this observation,
  we show that autoencoders that incorporate such invariances can provably identify
  the stable set of latents from the rest across different settings.'
