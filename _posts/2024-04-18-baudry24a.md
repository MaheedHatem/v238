title: Multi-armed bandits with guaranteed revenue per arm
software: https://github.com/DBaudry/Revenue_guaranteeing_bandits
abstract: We consider a Multi-Armed Bandit problem with covering constraints, where
  the primary goal is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum expected reward while
  maximizing the total cumulative reward. In this scenario, the optimal policy then
  belongs to some unknown feasible set. Unlike much of the existing literature, we
  do not assume the presence of a safe policy or a feasibility margin, which hinders
  the exclusive use of conservative approaches. Consequently, we propose and analyze
  an algorithm that switches between pessimism and optimism in the face of uncertainty.
  We prove both precise problem-dependent and problem-independent bounds, demonstrating
  that our algorithm achieves the best of the two approaches—depending on the presence
  or absence of a feasibility margin—in terms of constraint violation guarantees.
  Furthermore, our results indicate that playing greedily on the constraints actually
  outperforms pessimism when considering long-term violations rather than violations
  on a per-round basis.
