title: Queuing dynamics of asynchronous Federated Learning
abstract: We study asynchronous federated learning mechanisms with nodes having potentially
  different computational speeds. In such an environment, each node is allowed to
  work on models with potential delays and contribute to updates to the central server
  at its own pace. Existing analyses of such algorithms typically depend on intractable
  quantities such as the maximum node delay and do not consider the underlying queuing
  dynamics of the system. In this paper, we propose a non-uniform sampling scheme
  for the central server that allows for lower delays with better complexity, taking
  into account the closed Jackson network structure of the associated computational
  graph. Our experiments clearly show a significant improvement of our method over
  current state-of-the-art asynchronous algorithms on image classification problems.
