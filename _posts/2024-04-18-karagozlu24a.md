title: 'Learning the Pareto Set Under Incomplete Preferences: Pure Exploration in
  Vector Bandits'
software: https://github.com/Bilkent-CYBORG/PaVeBa
abstract: We study pure exploration in bandit problems with vector-valued rewards,
  where the goal is to (approximately) identify the Pareto set of arms given incomplete
  preferences induced by a polyhedral convex cone. We address the open problem of
  designing sample-efficient learning algorithms for such problems. We propose Pareto
  Vector Bandits (PaVeBa), an adaptive elimination algorithm that nearly matches the
  gap-dependent and worst-case lower bounds on the sample complexity of $(\epsilon,
  \delta)$-PAC Pareto set identification. Finally, we provide an in-depth numerical
  investigation of PaVeBa and its heuristic variants by comparing them with the state-of-the-art
  multi-objective and vector optimization algorithms on several real-world datasets
  with conflicting objectives.
