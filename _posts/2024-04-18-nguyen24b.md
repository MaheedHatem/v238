title: Towards Convergence Rates for Parameter Estimation in Gaussian-gated Mixture
  of Experts
software: https://github.com/Trung-TinNGUYEN/CRPE-GMoE
abstract: Originally introduced as a neural network for ensemble learning, mixture
  of experts (MoE) has recently become a fundamental building block of highly successful
  modern deep neural networks for heterogeneous data analysis in several applications
  of machine learning and statistics. Despite its popularity in practice, a satisfactory
  level of theoretical understanding of the MoE model is far from complete. To shed
  new light on this problem, we provide a convergence analysis for maximum likelihood
  estimation (MLE) in the Gaussian-gated MoE model. The main challenge of that analysis
  comes from the inclusion of covariates in the Gaussian gating functions and expert
  networks, which leads to their intrinsic interaction via some partial differential
  equations with respect to their parameters. We tackle these issues by designing
  novel Voronoi loss functions among parameters to accurately capture the heterogeneity
  of parameter estimation rates. Our findings reveal that the MLE has distinct behaviors
  under two complement settings of location parameters of the Gaussian gating functions,
  namely when all these parameters are non-zero versus when at least one among them
  vanishes. Notably, these behaviors can be characterized by the solvability of two
  different systems of polynomial equations. Finally, we conduct a simulation study
  to empirically verify our theoretical results.
