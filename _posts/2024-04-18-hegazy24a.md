title: Compression with Exact Error Distribution for Federated Learning
software: https://github.com/mahegz/CompWithExactError
abstract: Compression schemes have been extensively used in Federated Learning (FL)
  to reduce the communication cost of distributed learning. While most approaches
  rely on a bounded variance assumption of the noise produced by the compressor, this
  paper investigates the use of compression and aggregation schemes that produce a
  specific error distribution, e.g., Gaussian or Laplace, on the aggregated data.
  We present and analyze different aggregation schemes based on layered quantizers
  achieving exact error distribution. We provide different methods to leverage the
  proposed compression schemes to obtain compression-for-free in differential privacy
  applications. Our general compression methods can recover and improve standard FL
  schemes with Gaussian perturbations such as Langevin dynamics and randomized smoothing.
