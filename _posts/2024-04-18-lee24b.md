title: 'XB-MAML: Learning Expandable Basis Parameters for Effective Meta-Learning
  with Wide Task Coverage'
software: https://github.com/johnjaejunlee95/XB-MAML
abstract: Meta-learning, which pursues an effective initialization model, has emerged
  as a promising approach to handling unseen tasks. However, a limitation remains
  to be evident when a meta-learner tries to encompass a wide range of task distribution,
  e.g., learning across distinctive datasets or domains. Recently, a group of works
  has attempted to employ multiple model initializations to cover widely-ranging tasks,
  but they are limited in adaptively expanding initializations. We introduce XB-MAML,
  which learns expandable basis parameters, where they are linearly combined to form
  an effective initialization to a given task. XB-MAML observes the discrepancy between
  the vector space spanned by the basis and fine-tuned parameters to decide whether
  to expand the basis. Our method surpasses the existing works in the multi-domain
  meta-learning benchmarks and opens up new chances of meta-learning for obtaining
  the diverse inductive bias that can be combined to stretch toward the effective
  initialization for diverse unseen tasks.
