title: 'Sinkhorn Flow as Mirror Flow: A Continuous-Time Framework for Generalizing
  the Sinkhorn Algorithm'
abstract: Many problems in machine learning can be formulated as solving entropy-regularized
  optimal transport on the space of probability measures. The canonical approach involves
  the Sinkhorn iterates, renowned for their rich mathematical properties. Recently,
  the Sinkhorn algorithm has been recast within the mirror descent framework, thus
  benefiting from classical optimization theory insights. Here, we build upon this
  result by introducing a continuous-time analogue of the Sinkhorn algorithm. This
  perspective allows us to derive novel variants of Sinkhorn schemes that are robust
  to noise and bias. Moreover, our continuous-time dynamics offers a unified perspective
  on several recently discovered dynamics in machine learning and mathematics, such
  as the "Wasserstein mirror flow" of Deb et al. (2023) or the "mean-field Schr√∂dinger
  equation" of Claisse et al. (2023).
