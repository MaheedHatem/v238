title: Theory-guided Message Passing Neural Network for Probabilistic Inference
software: https://github.com/zijunjkl/AISTATS2024
abstract: Probabilistic inference can be tackled by minimizing a variational free
  energy through message passing. To improve performance, neural networks are adopted
  for message computation. Neural message learning is heuristic and requires strong
  guidance to perform well. In this work, we propose a {\em theory-guided message
  passing neural network} (TMPNN) for probabilistic inference. Inspired by existing
  work, we consider a generalized Bethe free energy which allows for a learnable variational
  assumption. Instead of using a black-box neural network for message computation,
  we utilize a general message equation and introduce a symbolic message function
  with semantically meaningful parameters. The analytically derived symbolic message
  function is seamlessly integrated into the MPNN framework, giving rise to the proposed
  TMPNN. TMPNN is trained using algorithmic supervision without requiring exact inference
  results. Leveraging the theory-guided symbolic function, TMPNN offers strengthened
  theoretical guarantees compared to conventional heuristic neural models. It presents
  a novel contribution by demonstrating its applicability to both MAP and marginal
  inference tasks, outperforming SOTAs in both cases. Furthermore, TMPNN provides
  improved generalizability across various graph structures and exhibits enhanced
  data efficiency.
