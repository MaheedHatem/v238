title: A Doubly Robust Approach to Sparse Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We propose a new regret minimization algorithm for episodic sparse linear
  Markov decision process (SMDP) where the state-transition distribution is a linear
  function of observed features. The only previously known algorithm for SMDP requires
  the knowledge of the sparsity parameter and oracle access to an unknown policy.
  We overcome these limitations by combining the doubly robust method that allows
  one to use feature vectors of \emph{all} actions with a novel analysis technique
  that enables the algorithm to use data from all periods in all episodes. The regret
  of the proposed algorithm is $\tilde{O}(\sigma^{-1}_{\min}s_{\star} H \sqrt{N})$,
  where $\sigma_{\min}$ denotes the restrictive the minimum eigenvalue of the average
  Gram matrix of feature vectors, $s_\star$ is the sparsity parameter, $H$ is the
  length of an episode, and $N$ is the number of rounds. We provide a lower regret
  bound that matches the upper bound to logarithmic factors on a newly identified
  subclass of SMDPs. Our numerical experiments support our theoretical results and
  demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm.
