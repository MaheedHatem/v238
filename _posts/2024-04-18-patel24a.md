title: Conformal Contextual Robust Optimization
software: https://github.com/yashpatel5400/csi
abstract: Data-driven approaches to predict-then-optimize decision-making problems
  seek to mitigate the risk of uncertainty region misspecification in safety-critical
  settings. Current approaches, however, suffer from considering overly conservative
  uncertainty regions, often resulting in suboptimal decision-making. To this end,
  we propose Conformal-Predict-Then-Optimize (CPO), a framework for leveraging highly
  informative, nonconvex conformal prediction regions over high-dimensional spaces
  based on conditional generative models, which have the desired distribution-free
  coverage guarantees. Despite guaranteeing robustness, such black-box optimization
  procedures alone inspire little confidence owing to the lack of explanation of why
  a particular decision was found to be optimal. We, therefore, augment CPO to additionally
  provide semantically meaningful visual summaries of the uncertainty regions to give
  qualitative intuition for the optimal decision. We highlight the CPO framework by
  demonstrating results on a suite of simulation-based inference benchmark tasks and
  a vehicle routing task based on probabilistic weather prediction.
