title: Quantized Fourier and Polynomial Features for more Expressive Tensor Network
  Models
software: https://github.com/fwesel/QFF
abstract: In the context of kernel machines, polynomial and Fourier features are commonly
  used to provide a nonlinear extension to linear models by mapping the data to a
  higher-dimensional space. Unless one considers the dual formulation of the learning
  problem, which renders exact large-scale learning unfeasible, the exponential increase
  of model parameters in the dimensionality of the data caused by their tensor-product
  structure prohibits to tackle high-dimensional problems. One of the possible approaches
  to circumvent this exponential scaling is to exploit the tensor structure present
  in the features by constraining the model weights to be an underparametrized tensor
  network. In this paper we quantize, i.e. further tensorize, polynomial and Fourier
  features. Based on this feature quantization we propose to quantize the associated
  model weights, yielding quantized models. We show that, for the same number of model
  parameters, the resulting quantized models have a higher bound on the VC-dimension
  as opposed to their non-quantized counterparts, at no additional computational cost
  while learning from identical features. We verify experimentally how this additional
  tensorization regularizes the learning problem by prioritizing the most salient
  features in the data and how it provides models with increased generalization capabilities.
  We finally benchmark our approach on large regression task, achieving state-of-the-art
  results on a laptop computer.
