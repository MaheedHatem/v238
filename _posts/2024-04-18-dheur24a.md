title: Probabilistic Calibration by Design for Neural Network Regression
software: https://github.com/Vekteur/quantile-recalibration-training
abstract: Generating calibrated and sharp neural network predictive distributions
  for regression problems is essential for optimal decision-making in many real-world
  applications. To address the miscalibration issue of neural networks, various methods
  have been proposed to improve calibration, including post-hoc methods that adjust
  predictions after training and regularization methods that act during training.
  While post-hoc methods have shown better improvement in calibration compared to
  regularization methods, the post-hoc step is completely independent of model training.
  We introduce a novel end-to-end model training procedure called Quantile Recalibration
  Training, integrating post-hoc calibration directly into the training process without
  additional parameters. We also present a unified algorithm that includes our method
  and other post-hoc and regularization methods, as particular cases. We demonstrate
  the performance of our method in a large-scale experiment involving 57 tabular regression
  datasets, showcasing improved predictive accuracy while maintaining calibration.
  We also conduct an ablation study to evaluate the significance of different components
  within our proposed method, as well as an in-depth analysis of the impact of the
  base model and different hyperparameters on predictive accuracy.
