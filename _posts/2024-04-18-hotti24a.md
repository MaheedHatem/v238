title: Benefits of Non-Linear Scale Parameterizations in Black Box Variational Inference
  through Smoothness Results and Gradient Variance Bounds
abstract: Black box variational inference has consistently produced impressive empirical
  results. Convergence guarantees require that the variational objective exhibits
  specific structural properties and that the noise of the gradient estimator can
  be controlled. In this work we study the smoothness and the variance of the gradient
  estimator for location-scale variational families with non-linear covariance parameterizations.
  Specifically, we derive novel theoretical results for the popular exponential covariance
  parameterization and tighter gradient variance bounds for the softplus parameterization.
  These results reveal the benefits of using non-linear scale parameterizations on
  large scale datasets. With a non-linear scale parameterization, the smoothness constant
  of the variational objective and the upper bound on the gradient variance decrease
  as the scale parameter becomes smaller. Learning posterior approximations with small
  scales is essential in Bayesian statistics with sufficient amount of data, since
  under appropriate assumptions, the posterior distribution is known to contract around
  the parameter of interest as the sample size increases. We validate our theoretical
  findings through empirical analysis on several large-scale datasets, underscoring
  the importance of non-linear parameterizations.
