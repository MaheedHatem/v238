title: 'FALCON: FLOP-Aware Combinatorial Optimization for Neural Network Pruning'
software: https://github.com/mazumder-lab/FALCON
abstract: The increasing computational demands of modern neural networks present deployment
  challenges on resource-constrained devices. Network pruning offers a solution to
  reduce model size and computational cost while maintaining performance. However,
  current pruning methods focus primarily on improving sparsity by reducing the number
  of nonzero parameters, often neglecting other deployment costs such as inference
  time, which are closely related to the number of floating-point operations (FLOPs).
  In this paper, we propose {FALCON}, a novel combinatorial-optimization-based framework
  for network pruning that jointly takes into account model accuracy (fidelity), FLOPs,
  and sparsity constraints. A main building block of our approach is an integer linear
  program (ILP) that simultaneously handles FLOP and sparsity constraints. We present
  a novel algorithm to approximately solve the ILP. We propose a novel first-order
  method for our optimization framework which makes use of our ILP solver. Using problem
  structure (e.g., the low-rank structure of approx. Hessian), we can address instances
  with millions of parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that {FALCON}Â achieves
  superior accuracy compared to other pruning approaches within a fixed FLOP budget.
  For instance, for ResNet50 with 20% of the total FLOPs retained, our approach improves
  the accuracy by 48% relative to state-of-the-art. Furthermore, in gradual pruning
  settings with re-training between pruning steps, our framework outperforms existing
  pruning methods, emphasizing the significance of incorporating both FLOP and sparsity
  constraints for effective network pruning.
