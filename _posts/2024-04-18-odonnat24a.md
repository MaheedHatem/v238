title: Leveraging Ensemble Diversity for Robust Self-Training in the Presence of Sample
  Selection Bias
software: https://github.com/ambroiseodt/tsim
abstract: Self-training is a well-known approach for semi-supervised learning. It
  consists of iteratively assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data for which the
  model is confident and treating them as labeled examples. For neural networks, \texttt{softmax}
  prediction probabilities are often used as a confidence measure, although they are
  known to be overconfident, even for wrong predictions. This phenomenon is particularly
  intensified in the presence of sample selection bias, i.e., when data labeling is
  subject to some constraints. To address this issue, we propose a novel confidence
  measure, called $\mathcal{T}$-similarity, built upon the prediction diversity of
  an ensemble of linear classifiers. We provide the theoretical analysis of our approach
  by studying stationary points and describing the relationship between the diversity
  of the individual members and their performance. We empirically demonstrate the
  benefit of our confidence measure for three different pseudo-labeling policies on
  classification datasets of various data modalities. The code is available at https://github.com/ambroiseodt/tsim.
