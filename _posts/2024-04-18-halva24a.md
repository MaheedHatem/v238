title: Identifiable Feature Learning for Spatial Data with Nonlinear ICA
software: https://github.com/cambridge-mlg/tprocess
abstract: Recently, nonlinear ICA has surfaced as a popular alternative to the many
  heuristic models used in deep representation learning and disentanglement. An advantage
  of nonlinear ICA is that a sophisticated identifiability theory has been developed;
  in particular, it has been proven that the original components can be recovered
  under sufficiently strong latent dependencies. Despite this general theory, practical
  nonlinear ICA algorithms have so far been mainly limited to data with one-dimensional
  latent dependencies, especially time-series data. In this paper, we introduce a
  new nonlinear ICA framework that employs $t$-process (TP) latent components which
  apply naturally to data with higher-dimensional dependency structures, such as spatial
  and spatio-temporal data. In particular, we develop a new learning and inference
  algorithm that extends variational inference methods to handle the combination of
  a deep neural network mixing function with the TP prior, and employs the method
  of inducing points for computational efficacy. On the theoretical side, we show
  that such TP independent components are identifiable under very general conditions.
  Further, Gaussian Process (GP) nonlinear ICA is established as a limit of the TP
  Nonlinear ICA model, and we prove that the identifiability of the latent components
  at this GP limit is more restricted. Namely, those components are identifiable if
  and only if they have distinctly different covariance kernels. Our algorithm and
  identifiability theorems are explored on simulated spatial data and real world spatio-temporal
  data.
