title: 'Equivalence Testing: The Power of Bounded Adaptivity'
abstract: 'Equivalence testing, a fundamental problem in the field of distribution
  testing, seeks to infer if two unknown distributions on $[n]$ are the same or far
  apart in the total variation distance. Conditional sampling has emerged as a powerful
  query model and has been investigated by theoreticians and practitioners alike,
  leading to the design of optimal algorithms albeit in a sequential setting (also
  referred to as adaptive tester). Given the profound impact of parallel computing
  over the past decades, there has been a strong desire to design algorithms that
  enable high parallelization. Despite significant algorithmic advancements over the
  last decade, parallelizable techniques (also termed non-adaptive testers) have $\tilde{O}(\log^{12}n)$
  query complexity, a prohibitively large complexity to be of practical usage. Therefore,
  the primary challenge is whether it is possible to design algorithms that enable
  high parallelization while achieving efficient query complexity. Our work provides
  an affirmative answer to the aforementioned challenge: we present a highly parallelizable
  tester with a query complexity of $\tilde{O}(\log n)$, achieved through a single
  round of adaptivity, marking a significant stride towards harmonizing parallelizability
  and efficiency in equivalence testing.'
