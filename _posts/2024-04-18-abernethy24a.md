title: 'Lexicographic Optimization: Algorithms and Stability'
abstract: 'A lexicographic maximum of a set $X \subseteq R^n$ is a vector in $X$ whose
  smallest component is as large as possible, and subject to that requirement, whose
  second smallest component is as large as possible, and so on for the third smallest
  component, etc. Lexicographic maximization has numerous practical and theoretical
  applications, including fair resource allocation, analyzing the implicit regularization
  of learning algorithms, and characterizing refinements of game-theoretic equilibria.
  We prove that a minimizer in $X$ of the exponential loss function $L_c(x) = \sum_i
  \exp(-c x_i)$ converges to a lexicographic maximum of $X$ as $c \to \infty$, provided
  that $X$ is \emph{stable} in the sense that a well-known iterative method for finding
  a lexicographic maximum of $X$ cannot be made to fail simply by reducing the required
  quality of each iterate by an arbitrarily tiny degree. Our result holds for both
  near and exact minimizers of the exponential loss, while earlier convergence results
  made much stronger assumptions about the set $X$ and only held for the exact minimizer.
  We are aware of no previous results showing a connection between the iterative method
  for computing a lexicographic maximum and exponential loss minimization. We show
  that every convex polytope is stable, but that there exist compact, convex sets
  that are not stable. We also provide the first analysis of the convergence rate
  of an exponential loss minimizer (near or exact) and discover a curious dichotomy:
  While the two smallest components of the vector converge to the lexicographically
  maximum values very quickly (at roughly the rate $\frac{\log n}{c}$), all other
  components can converge arbitrarily slowly.'
