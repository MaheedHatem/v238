title: Optimal Sparse Survival Trees
software: https://github.com/ruizhang1996/optimal-sparse-survival-trees-public
abstract: Interpretability is crucial for doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies
  and biotechnology corporations to analyze and make decisions for high stakes problems
  that involve human health. Tree-based methods have been widely adopted for survival
  analysis due to their appealing interpretablility and their ability to capture complex
  relationships. However, most existing methods to produce survival trees rely on
  heuristic (or greedy) algorithms, which risk producing sub-optimal models. We present
  a dynamic-programming-with-bounds approach that finds provably-optimal sparse survival
  tree models, frequently in only a few seconds.
