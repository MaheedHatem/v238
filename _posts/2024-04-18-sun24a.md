abstract: Generalization performance is a key metric in evaluating machine learning
  models when applied to real-world applications. Good generalization indicates the
  model can predict unseen data correctly when trained under a limited number of data.
  Federated learning (FL), which has emerged as a popular distributed learning framework,
  allows multiple devices or clients to train a shared model without violating privacy
  requirements. While the existing literature has studied extensively the generalization
  performances of centralized machine learning algorithms, similar analysis in the
  federated settings is either absent or with very restrictive assumptions on the
  loss functions. In this paper, we aim to analyze the generalization performances
  of federated learning by means of algorithmic stability, which measures the change
  of the output model of an algorithm when perturbing one data point. Three widely-used
  algorithms are studied, including FedAvg, SCAFFOLD, and FedProx, under convex and
  non-convex loss functions. Our analysis shows that the generalization performances
  of models trained by these three algorithms are closely related to the heterogeneity
  of clientsâ€™ datasets as well as the convergence behaviors of the algorithms. Particularly,
  in the i.i.d. setting, our results recover the classical results of stochastic gradient
  descent (SGD).
