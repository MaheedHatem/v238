title: Data-Adaptive Probabilistic Likelihood Approximation for Ordinary Differential
  Equations
software: https://github.com/mlysy/rodeo/
abstract: Estimating the parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is of
  fundamental importance in many scientific applications. While ODEs are typically
  approximated with deterministic algorithms, new research on probabilistic solvers
  indicates that they produce more reliable parameter estimates by better accounting
  for numerical errors. However, many ODE systems are highly sensitive to their parameter
  values. This produces deep local maxima in the likelihood function â€“ a problem which
  existing probabilistic solvers have yet to resolve. Here we present a novel probabilistic
  ODE likelihood approximation, DALTON, which can dramatically reduce parameter sensitivity
  by learning from noisy ODE measurements in a data-adaptive manner. Our approximation
  scales linearly in both ODE variables and time discretization points, and is applicable
  to ODEs with both partially-unobserved components and non-Gaussian measurement models.
  Several examples demonstrate that DALTON produces more accurate parameter estimates
  via numerical optimization than existing probabilistic ODE solvers, and even in
  some cases than the exact ODE likelihood itself.
