title: Sharpened Lazy Incremental Quasi-Newton Method
software: https://github.com/aakashlahoti/sliqn
abstract: 'The problem of minimizing the sum of $n$ functions in $d$ dimensions is
  ubiquitous in machine learning and statistics. In many applications where the number
  of observations $n$ is large, it is necessary to use incremental or stochastic methods,
  as their per-iteration cost is independent of $n$. Of these, Quasi-Newton (QN) methods
  strike a balance between the per-iteration cost and the convergence rate. Specifically,
  they exhibit a superlinear rate with $O(d^2)$ cost in contrast to the linear rate
  of first-order methods with $O(d)$ cost and the quadratic rate of second-order methods
  with $O(d^3)$ cost. However, existing incremental methods have notable shortcomings:
  Incremental Quasi-Newton (IQN) only exhibits asymptotic superlinear convergence.
  In contrast, Incremental Greedy BFGS (IGS) offers explicit superlinear convergence
  but suffers from poor empirical performance and has a per-iteration cost of $O(d^3)$.
  To address these issues, we introduce the Sharpened Lazy Incremental Quasi-Newton
  Method (SLIQN) that achieves the best of both worlds: an explicit superlinear convergence
  rate, and superior empirical performance at a per-iteration $O(d^2)$ cost. SLIQN
  features two key changes: first, it incorporates a hybrid strategy of using both
  classic and greedy BFGS updates, allowing it to empirically outperform both IQN
  and IGS. Second, it employs a clever constant multiplicative factor along with a
  lazy propagation strategy, which enables it to have a cost of $O(d^2)$. Additionally,
  our experiments demonstrate the superiority of SLIQN over other incremental and
  stochastic Quasi-Newton variants and establish its competitiveness with second-order
  incremental methods.'
