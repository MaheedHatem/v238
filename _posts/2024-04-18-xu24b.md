title: Uncertainty-aware Continuous Implicit Neural Representations for Remote Sensing
  Object Counting
software: https://github.com/SiyuanXu-tamu/UNIC
abstract: Many existing object counting methods rely on density map estimation (DME)
  of the discrete grid representation by decoding extracted image semantic features
  from designed convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Relying on discrete density
  maps not only leads to information loss dependent on the original image resolution,
  but also has a scalability issue when analyzing high-resolution images with cubically
  increasing memory complexity. Furthermore, none of the existing methods can offer
  reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) for the derived count estimates. To overcome
  these limitations, we design UNcertainty-aware, hypernetwork-based Implicit neural
  representations for Counting (UNIC) to assign probabilities and the corresponding
  counting confidence over continuous spatial coordinates. We derive a sampling-based
  Bayesian counting loss function and develop the corresponding model training algorithm.
  UNIC outperforms existing methods on the Remote Sensing Object Counting (RSOC) dataset
  with reliable UQ and improved interpretability of the derived count estimates. Our
  code is available at https://github.com/SiyuanXu-tamu/UNIC.
