title: Membership Testing in Markov Equivalence Classes via Independence Queries
abstract: 'Understanding causal relationships between variables is a fundamental problem
  with broad impact in numerous scientific fields. While extensive research has been
  dedicated to \emph{learning} causal graphs from data, its complementary concept
  of \emph{testing} causal relationships has remained largely unexplored. While \emph{learning}
  involves the task of recovering the Markov equivalence class (MEC) of the underlying
  causal graph from observational data, the \emph{testing} counterpart addresses the
  following critical question: \emph{Given a specific MEC and observational data from
  some causal graph, can we determine if the data-generating causal graph belongs
  to the given MEC?} We explore constraint-based testing methods by establishing bounds
  on the required number of conditional independence tests. Our bounds are in terms
  of the size of the maximum undirected clique ($s$) of the given MEC. In the worst
  case, we show a lower bound of $\exp(\Omega(s))$ independence tests. We then give
  an algorithm that resolves the task with $\exp(O(s))$ tests, matching our lower
  bound. Compared to the \emph{learning} problem, where algorithms often use a number
  of independence tests that is exponential in the maximum in-degree, this shows that
  \emph{testing} is relatively easier. In particular, it requires exponentially less
  independence tests in graphs featuring high in-degrees and small clique sizes. Additionally,
  using the DAG associahedron, we provide a geometric interpretation of testing versus
  learning and discuss how our testing result can aid learning.'
