title: Efficient Low-Dimensional Compression of Overparameterized Models
software: https://github.com/soominkwon/comp-deep-nets
abstract: In this work, we present a novel approach for compressing overparameterized
  models, developed through studying their learning dynamics. We observe that for
  many deep models, updates to the weight matrices occur within a low-dimensional
  invariant subspace. For deep linear models, we demonstrate that their principal
  components are fitted incrementally within a small subspace, and use these insights
  to propose a compression algorithm for deep linear networks that involve decreasing
  the width of their intermediate layers. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness
  of our compression technique on matrix recovery problems. Remarkably, by using an
  initialization that exploits the structure of the problem, we observe that our compressed
  network converges faster than the original network, consistently yielding smaller
  recovery errors. We substantiate this observation by developing a theory focused
  on deep matrix factorization. Finally, we empirically demonstrate how our compressed
  model has the potential to improve the utility of deep nonlinear models. Overall,
  our algorithm improves the training efficiency by more than 2x, without compromising
  generalization.
