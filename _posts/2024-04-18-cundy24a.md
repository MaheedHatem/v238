title: Privacy-Constrained Policies via Mutual Information Regularized Policy Gradients
software: https://github.com/ermongroup/private-rl
abstract: As reinforcement learning techniques are increasingly applied to real-world
  decision problems, attention has turned to how these algorithms use potentially
  sensitive information. We consider the task of training a policy that maximizes
  reward while minimizing disclosure of certain sensitive state variables through
  the actions. We give examples of how this setting covers real-world problems in
  privacy for sequential decision-making. We solve this problem in the policy gradients
  framework by introducing a regularizer based on the mutual information (MI) between
  the sensitive state and the actions. We develop a model-based stochastic gradient
  estimator for optimization of privacy-constrained policies. We also discuss an alternative
  MI regularizer that serves as an upper bound to our main MI regularizer and can
  be optimized in a model-free setting, and a powerful direct estimator that can be
  used in an environment with differentiable dynamics. We contrast previous work in
  differentially-private RL to our mutual-information formulation of information disclosure.
  Experimental results show that our training method results in policies that hide
  the sensitive state, even in challenging high-dimensional tasks.
