title: 'Euclidean, Projective, Conformal: Choosing a Geometric Algebra for Equivariant
  Transformers'
abstract: The Geometric Algebra Transformer (GATr) is a versatile architecture for
  geometric deep learning based on projective geometric algebra. We generalize this
  architecture into a blueprint that allows one to construct a scalable transformer
  architecture given any geometric (or Clifford) algebra. We study versions of this
  architecture for Euclidean, projective, and conformal algebras, all of which are
  suited to represent 3D data, and evaluate them in theory and practice. The simplest
  Euclidean architecture is computationally cheap, but has a smaller symmetry group
  and is not as sample-efficient, while the projective model is not sufficiently expressive.
  Both the conformal algebra and an improved version of the projective algebra define
  powerful, performant architectures.
