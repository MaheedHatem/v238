title: Multi-objective Optimization via Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Gradient Flow
software: https://github.com/yinuoren/particlewfr
abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) aims to optimize multiple, possibly conflicting
  objectives with widespread applications. We introduce a novel interacting particle
  method for MOO inspired by molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach combines
  overdamped Langevin and birth-death dynamics, incorporating a “dominance potential”
  to steer particles toward global Pareto optimality. In contrast to previous methods,
  our method is able to relocate dominated particles, making it particularly adept
  at managing Pareto fronts of complicated geometries. Our method is also theoretically
  grounded as a Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao gradient flow with convergence guarantees.
  Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
  on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets.
