title: Fair k-center Clustering with Outliers
software: https://github.com/amgt-d1/Fair-k-center-w-outliers
abstract: The importance of dealing with big data is further increasing, as machine
  learning (ML) systems obtain useful knowledge from big datasets. However, using
  all data is practically prohibitive because of the massive sizes of the datasets,
  so summarizing them by centers obtained from k-center clustering is a promising
  approach. We have two concerns here. One is fairness, because if the summary does
  not have some specific groups, subsequent applications may provide unfair results
  for the groups. The other is the presence of outliers, and if outliers dominate
  the summary, it cannot be useful. To overcome these concerns, we address the problem
  of fair k-center clustering with outliers. Although prior works studied the fair
  k-center clustering problem, they do not consider outliers. This paper yields a
  linear time algorithm that satisfies the fairness constraint of our problem and
  probabilistically guarantees the almost 3-approximation bound. Its empirical efficiency
  and effectiveness are also reported.
