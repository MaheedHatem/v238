title: Low-rank MDPs with Continuous Action Spaces
abstract: Low-Rank Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have recently emerged as a promising
  framework within the domain of reinforcement learning (RL), as they allow for provably
  approximately correct (PAC) learning guarantees while also incorporating ML algorithms
  for representation learning. However, current methods for low-rank MDPs are limited
  in that they only consider finite action spaces, and give vacuous bounds as $|\mathcal{A}|
  \to \infty$, which greatly limits their applicability. In this work, we study the
  problem of extending such methods to settings with continuous actions, and explore
  multiple concrete approaches for performing this extension. As a case study, we
  consider the seminal FLAMBE algorithm (Agarwal et al., 2020), which is a reward-agnostic
  method for PAC RL with low-rank MDPs. We show that, without any modifications to
  the algorithm, we obtain a similar PAC bound when actions are allowed to be continuous.
  Specifically, when the model for transition functions satisfies a Hölder smoothness
  condition w.r.t. actions, and either the policy class has a uniformly bounded minimum
  density or the reward function is also Hölder smooth, we obtain a polynomial PAC
  bound that depends on the order of smoothness.
