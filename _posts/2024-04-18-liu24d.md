title: 'Distributionally Robust Off-Dynamics Reinforcement Learning: Provable Efficiency
  with Linear Function Approximation'
software: https://github.com/panxulab/Distributionally-Robust-LSVI-UCB
abstract: We study off-dynamics Reinforcement Learning (RL), where the policy is trained
  on a source domain and deployed to a distinct target domain. We aim to solve this
  problem via online distributionally robust Markov decision processes (DRMDPs), where
  the learning algorithm actively interacts with the source domain while seeking the
  optimal performance under the worst possible dynamics that is within an uncertainty
  set of the source domain’s transition kernel. We provide the first study on online
  DRMDPs with function approximation for off-dynamics RL. We find that DRMDPs’ dual
  formulation can induce nonlinearity, even when the nominal transition kernel is
  linear, leading to error propagation. By designing a $d$-rectangular uncertainty
  set using the total variation distance, we remove this additional nonlinearity and
  bypass the error propagation. We then introduce DR-LSVI-UCB, the first provably
  efficient online DRMDP algorithm for off-dynamics RL with function approximation,
  and establish a polynomial suboptimality bound that is independent of the state
  and action space sizes. Our work makes the first step towards a deeper understanding
  of the provable efficiency of online DRMDPs with linear function approximation.
  Finally, we substantiate the performance and robustness of DR-LSVI-UCB through different
  numerical experiments.
