title: 'Soft-constrained Schrödinger Bridge: a Stochastic Control Approach'
software: https://github.com/gargjhanvi/Soft-constrained-Schrodinger-Bridge-a-Stochastic-Control-Approach
abstract: Schrödinger bridge can be viewed as a continuous-time stochastic control
  problem where the goal is to find an optimally controlled diffusion process whose
  terminal distribution coincides with a pre-specified target distribution. We propose
  to generalize this problem by allowing the terminal distribution to differ from
  the target but penalizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions.
  We call this new control problem soft-constrained Schrödinger bridge (SSB). The
  main contribution of this work is a theoretical derivation of the solution to SSB,
  which shows that the terminal distribution of the optimally controlled process is
  a geometric mixture of the target and some other distribution. This result is further
  extended to a time series setting. One application is the development of robust
  generative diffusion models. We propose a score matching-based algorithm for sampling
  from geometric mixtures and showcase its use via a numerical example for the MNIST
  data set.
