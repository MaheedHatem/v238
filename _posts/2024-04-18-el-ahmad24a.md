abstract: 'Leveraging the kernel trick in both the input and output spaces, surrogate
  kernel methods are a flexible and theoretically grounded solution to structured
  output prediction. If they provide state-of-the-art performance on complex data
  sets of moderate size (e.g., in chemoinformatics), these approaches however fail
  to scale. We propose to equip surrogate kernel methods with sketching-based approximations,
  applied to both the input and output feature maps. We prove excess risk bounds on
  the original structured prediction problem, showing how to attain close-to-optimal
  rates with a reduced sketch size that depends on the eigendecay of the input/output
  covariance operators. From a computational perspective, we show that the two approximations
  have distinct but complementary impacts: sketching the input kernel mostly reduces
  training time, while sketching the output kernel decreases the inference time. Empirically,
  our approach is shown to scale, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark
  data sets where non-sketched methods are intractable.'
