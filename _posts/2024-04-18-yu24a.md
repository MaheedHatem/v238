title: Riemannian Laplace Approximation with the Fisher Metric
software: https://github.com/ksnxr/RLAF
abstract: Laplaceâ€™s method approximates a target density with a Gaussian distribution
  at its mode. It is computationally efficient and asymptotically exact for Bayesian
  inference due to the Bernstein-von Mises theorem, but for complex targets and finite-data
  posteriors it is often too crude an approximation. A recent generalization of the
  Laplace Approximation transforms the Gaussian approximation according to a chosen
  Riemannian geometry providing a richer approximation family, while still retaining
  computational efficiency. However, as shown here, its properties depend heavily
  on the chosen metric, indeed the metric adopted in previous work results in approximations
  that are overly narrow as well as being biased even at the limit of infinite data.
  We correct this shortcoming by developing the approximation family further, deriving
  two alternative variants that are exact at the limit of infinite data, extending
  the theoretical analysis of the method, and demonstrating practical improvements
  in a range of experiments.
