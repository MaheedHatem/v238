title: Backward Filtering Forward Deciding in Linear Non-Gaussian State Space Models
software: https://github.com/yunpli2sp/NUP4SSM/
abstract: The paper considers linear state space models with non-Gaussian inputs and/or
  constraints. As shown previously, NUP representations (normal with unknown parameters)
  allow to compute MAP estimates in such models by iterating Kalman smoothing recursions.
  In this paper, we propose to compute such MAP estimates by iterating backward-forward
  recursions where the forward recursion amounts to coordinatewise input estimation.
  The advantages of the proposed approach include faster convergence, no “zero-variance
  stucking”, and easier control of constraint satisfaction. The approach is demonstrated
  with simulation results of exemplary applications including (i) regression with
  non-Gaussian priors or constraints on k-th order differences and (ii) control with
  linearly constrained inputs.
