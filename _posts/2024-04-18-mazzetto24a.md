title: An Improved Algorithm for Learning Drifting Discrete Distributions
abstract: We present a new adaptive algorithm for learning discrete distributions
  under distribution drift. In this setting, we observe a sequence of independent
  samples from a discrete distribution that is changing over time, and the goal is
  to estimate the current distribution. Since we have access to only a single sample
  for each time step, a good estimation requires a careful choice of the number of
  past samples to use. To use more samples, we must resort to samples further in the
  past, and we incur a drift error due to the bias introduced by the change in distribution.
  On the other hand, if we use a small number of past samples, we incur a large statistical
  error as the estimation has a high variance. We present a novel adaptive algorithm
  that can solve this trade-off without any prior knowledge of the drift. Unlike previous
  adaptive results, our algorithm characterizes the statistical error using data-dependent
  bounds. This technicality enables us to overcome the limitations of the previous
  work that require a fixed finite support whose size is known in advance and that
  cannot change over time. Additionally, we can obtain tighter bounds depending on
  the complexity of the drifting distribution, and also consider distributions with
  infinite support.
