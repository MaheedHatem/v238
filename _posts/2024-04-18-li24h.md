title: Optimal Exploration is no harder than Thompson Sampling
software: https://github.com/zhaoqil/PureExpThompsonSampling/tree/aistats_2024_code
abstract: 'Given a set of arms $\mathcal{Z}\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and an unknown parameter
  vector $\theta_\ast\in\mathbb{R}^d$, the pure exploration linear bandits problem
  aims to return $\arg\max_{z\in \mathcal{Z}} z^{\top}\theta_{\ast}$, with high probability
  through noisy measurements of $x^{\top}\theta_{\ast}$ with $x\in \mathcal{X}\subset
  \mathbb{R}^d$. Existing (asymptotically) optimal methods require either a) potentially
  costly projections for each arm $z\in \mathcal{Z}$ or b) explicitly maintaining
  a subset of $\mathcal{Z}$ under consideration at each time. This complexity is at
  odds with the popular and simple Thompson Sampling algorithm for regret minimization,
  which just requires access to a posterior sampling and argmax oracle, and does not
  need to enumerate $\mathcal{Z}$ at any point. Unfortunately, Thompson sampling is
  known to be sub-optimal for pure exploration. In this work, we pose a natural question:
  is there an algorithm that can explore optimally and only needs the same computational
  primitives as Thompson Sampling? We answer the question in the affirmative. We provide
  an algorithm that leverages only sampling and argmax oracles and achieves an exponential
  convergence rate, with the exponent equal to the exponent of the optimal fixed allocation
  asymptotically. In addition, we show that our algorithm can be easily implemented
  and performs as well empirically as existing asymptotically optimal methods.'
