title: 'Sample-Efficient Personalization: Modeling User Parameters as Low Rank Plus
  Sparse Components'
abstract: Personalization of machine learning (ML) predictions for individual users/domains/enterprises
  is critical for practical recommendation systems. Standard personalization approaches
  involve learning a user/domain specific \emph{embedding} that is fed into a fixed
  global model which can be limiting. On the other hand, personalizing/fine-tuning
  model itself for each user/domain — a.k.a meta-learning — has high storage/infrastructure
  cost. Moreover, rigorous theoretical studies of scalable personalization approaches
  have been very limited. To address the above issues, we propose a novel meta-learning
  style approach that models network weights as a sum of low-rank and sparse components.
  This captures common information from multiple individuals/users together in the
  low-rank part while sparse part captures user-specific idiosyncrasies. We then study
  the framework in the linear setting, where the problem reduces to that of estimating
  the sum of a rank-$r$ and a $k$-column sparse matrix using a small number of linear
  measurements. We propose a computationally efficient alternating minimization method
  with iterative hard thresholding — AMHT-LRS — to learn the low-rank and sparse part.
  Theoretically, for the realizable Gaussian data setting, we show that AMHT-LRS solves
  the problem efficiently with nearly optimal sample complexity. Finally, a significant
  challenge in personalization is ensuring privacy of each user’s sensitive data.
  We alleviate this problem by proposing a differentially private variant of our method
  that also is equipped with strong generalization guarantees.
