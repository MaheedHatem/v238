title: Multi-Agent Bandit Learning through Heterogeneous Action Erasure Channels
software: https://github.com/mervekarakas/mamab_erasures
abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) systems are witnessing an upswing in applications
  within multi-agent distributed environments, leading to the advancement of collaborative
  MAB algorithms. In such settings, communication between agents executing actions
  and the primary learner making decisions can hinder the learning process. A prevalent
  challenge in distributed learning is action erasure, often induced by communication
  delays and/or channel noise. This results in agents possibly not receiving the intended
  action from the learner, subsequently leading to misguided feedback. In this paper,
  we introduce novel algorithms that enable learners to interact concurrently with
  distributed agents across heterogeneous action erasure channels with different action
  erasure probabilities. We illustrate that, in contrast to existing bandit algorithms,
  which experience linear regret, our algorithms assure sub-linear regret guarantees.
  Our proposed solutions are founded on a meticulously crafted repetition protocol
  and scheduling of learning across heterogeneous channels. To our knowledge, these
  are the first algorithms capable of effectively learning through heterogeneous action
  erasure channels. We substantiate the superior performance of our algorithm through
  numerical experiments, emphasizing their practical significance in addressing issues
  related to communication constraints and delays in multi-agent environments.
