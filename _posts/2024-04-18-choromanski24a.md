title: Learning a Fourier Transform for Linear Relative Positional Encodings in Transformers
abstract: We propose a new class of linear Transformers called FourierLearner-Transformers
  (FLTs), which incorporate a wide range of relative positional encoding mechanisms
  (RPEs). These include regular RPE techniques applied for sequential data, as well
  as novel RPEs operating on geometric data embedded in higher-dimensional Euclidean
  spaces. FLTs construct the optimal RPE mechanism implicitly by learning its spectral
  representation. As opposed to other architectures combining efficient low-rank linear
  attention with RPEs, FLTs remain practical in terms of their memory usage and do
  not require additional assumptions about the structure of the RPE mask. Besides,
  FLTs allow for applying certain structural inductive bias techniques to specify
  masking strategies, e.g. they provide a way to learn the so-called local RPEs introduced
  in this paper and give accuracy gains as compared with several other linear Transformers
  for language modeling. We also thoroughly test FLTs on other data modalities and
  tasks, such as image classification, 3D molecular modeling, and learnable optimizers.
  To the best of our knowledge, for 3D molecular data, FLTs are the first Transformer
  architectures providing linear attention and incorporating RPE masking.
