title: Efficient Quantum Agnostic Improper Learning of Decision Trees
abstract: The agnostic setting is the hardest generalization of the PAC model since
  it is akin to learning with adversarial noise. In this paper, we give a poly $(n,
  t, 1/\epsilon)$ quantum algorithm for learning size $t$ decision trees over $n$-bit
  inputs with uniform marginal over instances, in the agnostic setting, without membership
  queries (MQ). This is the first algorithm (classical or quantum) for efficiently
  learning decision trees without MQ. First, we construct a quantum agnostic weak
  learner by designing a quantum variant of the classical Goldreich-Levin algorithm
  that works with strongly biased function oracles. Next, we show how to quantize
  the agnostic boosting algorithm by Kalai and Kanade (2009) to obtain the first efficient
  quantum agnostic boosting algorithm (that has a polynomial speedup over existing
  adaptive quantum boosting algorithms). We then use the quantum agnostic boosting
  algorithm to boost the weak quantum agnostic learner constructed previously to obtain
  a quantum agnostic learner for decision trees. Using the above framework, we also
  give quantum decision tree learning algorithms without MQ in weaker noise models.
