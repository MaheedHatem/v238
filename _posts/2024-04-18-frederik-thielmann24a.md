  Neural Regression Beyond the Mean'

abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be highly effective in a variety
  of tasks, making them the go-to method for problems requiring high-level predictive
  power. Despite this success, the inner workings of DNNs are often not transparent,
  making them difficult to interpret or understand. This lack of interpretability
  has led to increased research on inherently interpretable neural networks in recent
  years. Models such as Neural Additive Models (NAMs) achieve visual interpretability
  through the combination of classical statistical methods with DNNs. However, these
  approaches only concentrate on mean response predictions, leaving out other properties
  of the response distribution of the underlying data. We propose Neural Additive
  Models for Location Scale and Shape (NAMLSS), a modelling framework that combines
  the predictive power of classical deep learning models with the inherent advantages
  of distributional regression while maintaining the interpretability of additive
  models. The code is available at the following link: \url{https://github.com/AnFreTh/NAMpy}'
