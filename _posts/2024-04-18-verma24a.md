title: Variational Gaussian Process Diffusion Processes
software: https://github.com/AaltoML/vi-diffusion-processes
abstract: Diffusion processes are a class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
  providing a rich family of expressive models that arise naturally in dynamic modelling
  tasks. Probabilistic inference and learning under generative models with latent
  processes endowed with a non-linear diffusion process prior are intractable problems.
  We build upon work within variational inference, approximating the posterior process
  as a linear diffusion process, and point out pathologies in the approach. We propose
  an alternative parameterization of the Gaussian variational process using a site-based
  exponential family description. This allows us to trade a slow inference algorithm
  with fixed-point iterations for a fast algorithm for convex optimization akin to
  natural gradient descent, which also provides a better objective for learning model
  parameters.
