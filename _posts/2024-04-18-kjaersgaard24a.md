title: Fair Soft Clustering
software: https://github.com/RuneDK93/fair-soft-clustering
abstract: Scholars in the machine learning community have recently focused on analyzing
  the fairness of learning models, including clustering algorithms. In this work we
  study fair clustering in a probabilistic (soft) setting, where observations may
  belong to several clusters determined by probabilities. We introduce new probabilistic
  fairness metrics, which generalize and extend existing non-probabilistic fairness
  frameworks and propose an algorithm for obtaining a fair probabilistic cluster solution
  from a data representation known as a fairlet decomposition. Finally, we demonstrate
  our proposed fairness metrics and algorithm by constructing a fair Gaussian mixture
  model on three real-world datasets. We achieve this by identifying balanced micro-clusters
  which minimize the distances induced by the model, and on which traditional clustering
  can be performed while ensuring the fairness of the solution.
