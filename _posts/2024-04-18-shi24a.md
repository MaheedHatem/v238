title: Learning Cartesian Product Graphs with Laplacian Constraints
software: https://github.com/Mishne-Lab/MWGL
abstract: Graph Laplacian learning, also known as network topology inference, is a
  problem of great interest to multiple communities. In Gaussian graphical models
  (GM), graph learning amounts to endowing covariance selection with the Laplacian
  structure. In graph signal processing (GSP), it is essential to infer the unobserved
  graph from the outputs of a filtering system. In this paper, we study the problem
  of learning Cartesian product graphs under Laplacian constraints. The Cartesian
  graph product is a natural way for modeling higher-order conditional dependencies
  and is also the key for generalizing GSP to multi-way tensors. We establish statistical
  consistency for the penalized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of a Cartesian
  product Laplacian, and propose an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. We also
  extend our method for efficient joint graph learning and imputation in the presence
  of structural missing values. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
  that our method is superior to previous GSP and GM methods.
