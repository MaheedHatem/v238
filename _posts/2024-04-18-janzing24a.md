title: Quantifying intrinsic causal contributions via structure preserving interventions
software: https://github.com/janzing/janzing.github.io/tree/master/code_ICC_paper
abstract: We propose a notion of causal influence that describes the ‘intrinsic’ part
  of the contribution of a node on a target node in a DAG. By recursively writing
  each node as a function of the upstream noise terms, we separate the intrinsic information
  added by each node from the one obtained from its ancestors. To interpret the intrinsic
  information as a causal contribution, we consider ‘structure-preserving interventions’
  that randomize each node in a way that mimics the usual dependence on the parents
  and does not perturb the observed joint distribution. To get a measure that is invariant
  across arbitrary orderings of nodes we use Shapley based symmetrization and show
  that it reduces in the linear case to simple ANOVA after resolving the target node
  into noise variables. We describe our contribution analysis for variance and entropy,
  but contributions for other target metrics can be defined analogously.
