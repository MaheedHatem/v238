title: On the connection between Noise-Contrastive Estimation and Contrastive Divergence
software: https://github.com/jackonelli/nce_cd_cis/tree/test_merge
abstract: Noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) is a popular method for estimating unnormalised
  probabilistic models, such as energy-based models, which are effective for modelling
  complex data distributions. Unlike classical maximum likelihood (ML) estimation
  that relies on importance sampling (resulting in ML-IS) or MCMC (resulting in contrastive
  divergence, CD), NCE uses a proxy criterion to avoid the need for evaluating an
  often intractable normalisation constant. Despite apparent conceptual differences,
  we show that two NCE criteria, ranking NCE (RNCE) and conditional NCE (CNCE), can
  be viewed as ML estimation methods. Specifically, RNCE is equivalent to ML estimation
  combined with conditional importance sampling, and both RNCE and CNCE are special
  cases of CD. These findings bridge the gap between the two method classes and allow
  us to apply techniques from the ML-IS and CD literature to NCE, offering several
  advantageous extensions.
