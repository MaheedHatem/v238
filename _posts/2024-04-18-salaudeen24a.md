title: Causally Inspired Regularization Enables Domain General Representations
software: https://github.com/olawalesalaudeen/tcri
abstract: 'Given a causal graph representing the data-generating process shared across
  different domains/distributions, enforcing sufficient graph-implied conditional
  independencies can identify domain-general (non-spurious) feature representations.
  For the standard input-output predictive setting, we categorize the set of graphs
  considered in the literature into two distinct groups: (i) those in which the empirical
  risk minimizer across training domains gives domain-general representations and
  (ii) those where it does not. For the latter case (ii), we propose a novel framework
  with regularizations, which we demonstrate are sufficient for identifying domain-general
  feature representations without a priori knowledge (or proxies) of the spurious
  features. Empirically, our proposed method is effective for both (semi) synthetic
  and real-world data, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in average and
  worst-domain transfer accuracy.'
