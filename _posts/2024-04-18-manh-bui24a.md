title: 'Density-Regression: Efficient and Distance-aware Deep Regressor for Uncertainty
  Estimation under Distribution Shifts'
software: https://github.com/Angie-Lab-JHU/density_regression
abstract: Morden deep ensembles technique achieves strong uncertainty estimation performance
  by going through multiple forward passes with different models. This is at the price
  of a high storage space and a slow speed in the inference (test) time. To address
  this issue, we propose Density-Regression, a method that leverages the density function
  in uncertainty estimation and achieves fast inference by a single forward pass.
  We prove it is distance aware on the feature space, which is a necessary condition
  for a neural network to produce high-quality uncertainty estimation under distribution
  shifts. Empirically, we conduct experiments on regression tasks with the cubic toy
  dataset, benchmark UCI, weather forecast with time series, and depth estimation
  under real-world shifted applications. We show that Density-Regression has competitive
  uncertainty estimation performance under distribution shifts with modern deep regressors
  while using a lower model size and a faster inference speed.
