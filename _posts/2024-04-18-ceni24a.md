title: Random Oscillators Network for Time Series Processing
software: https://github.com/AndreaCossu/RandomizedCoupledOscillators
abstract: We introduce the Random Oscillators Network (RON), a physically-inspired
  recurrent model derived from a network of heterogeneous oscillators. Unlike traditional
  recurrent neural networks, RON keeps the connections between oscillators untrained
  by leveraging on smart random initialisations, leading to exceptional computational
  efficiency. A rigorous theoretical analysis finds the necessary and sufficient conditions
  for the stability of RON, highlighting the natural tendency of RON to lie at the
  edge of stability, a regime of configurations offering particularly powerful and
  expressive models. Through an extensive empirical evaluation on several benchmarks,
  we show four main advantages of RON. 1) RON shows excellent long-term memory and
  sequence classification ability, outperforming other randomised approaches. 2) RON
  outperforms fully-trained recurrent models and state-of-the-art randomised models
  in chaotic time series forecasting. 3) RON provides expressive internal representations
  even in a small parametrisation regime making it amenable to be deployed on low-powered
  devices and at the edge. 4) RON is up to two orders of magnitude faster than fully-trained
  models.
