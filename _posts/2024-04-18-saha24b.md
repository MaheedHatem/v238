title: Testing exchangeability by pairwise betting
abstract: 'In this paper, we address the problem of testing exchangeability of a sequence
  of random variables, $X_1, X_2,\cdots$. This problem has been studied under the
  recently popular framework of \emph{testing by betting}. But the mapping of testing
  problems to game is not one to one: many games can be designed for the same test.
  Past work established that it is futile to play single game betting on every observation:
  test martingales in the data filtration are powerless. Two avenues have been explored
  to circumvent this impossibility: betting in a reduced filtration (wealth is a test
  martingale in a coarsened filtration), or playing many games in parallel (wealth
  is an e-process in the data filtration). The former has proved to be difficult to
  theoretically analyze, while the latter only works for binary or discrete observation
  spaces. Here, we introduce a different approach that circumvents both drawbacks.
  We design a new (yet simple) game in which we observe the data sequence in pairs.
  Even though betting on individual observations is futile, we show that betting on
  pairs of observations is not. To elaborate, we prove that our game leads to a nontrivial
  test martingale, which is interesting because it has been obtained by shrinking
  the filtration very slightly. We show that our test controls type-1 error despite
  continuous monitoring, and is consistent for both binary and continuous observations,
  under a broad class of alternatives. Due to the shrunk filtration, optional stopping
  is only allowed at even stopping times: a relatively minor price. We provide a variety
  of simulations that align with our theoretical findings.'
