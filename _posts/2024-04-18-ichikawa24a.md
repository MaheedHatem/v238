title: 'Learning Dynamics in Linear VAE: Posterior Collapse Threshold, Superfluous
  Latent Space Pitfalls, and Speedup with KL Annealing'

abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) face a notorious problem wherein the variational
  posterior often aligns closely with the prior, a phenomenon known as posterior collapse,
  which hinders the quality of representation learning. To mitigate this problem,
  an adjustable hyperparameter $\beta$ and a strategy for annealing this parameter,
  called KL annealing, are proposed. This study presents a theoretical analysis of
  the learning dynamics in a minimal VAE. It is rigorously proved that the dynamics
  converge to a deterministic process within the limit of large input dimensions,
  thereby enabling a detailed dynamical analysis of the generalization error. Furthermore,
  the analysis shows that the VAE initially learns entangled representations and gradually
  acquires disentangled representations. A fixed-point analysis of the deterministic
  process reveals that when $\beta$ exceeds a certain threshold, posterior collapse
  becomes inevitable regardless of the learning period. Additionally, the superfluous
  latent variables for the data-generative factors lead to overfitting of the background
  noise; this adversely affects both generalization and learning convergence. The
  analysis further unveiled that appropriately tuned KL annealing can accelerate convergence.
