title: 'Adaptive Batch Sizes for Active Learning: A Probabilistic Numerics Approach'
software: https://github.com/ma921/AdaBatAL
abstract: Active learning parallelization is widely used, but typically relies on
  fixing the batch size throughout experimentation. This fixed approach is inefficient
  because of a dynamic trade-off between cost and speed—larger batches are more costly,
  smaller batches lead to slower wall-clock run-times—and the trade-off may change
  over the run (larger batches are often preferable earlier). To address this trade-off,
  we propose a novel Probabilistic Numerics framework that adaptively changes batch
  sizes. By framing batch selection as a quadrature task, our integration-error-aware
  algorithm facilitates the automatic tuning of batch sizes to meet predefined quadrature
  precision objectives, akin to how typical optimizers terminate based on convergence
  thresholds. This approach obviates the necessity for exhaustive searches across
  all potential batch sizes. We also extend this to scenarios with constrained active
  learning and constrained optimization, interpreting constraint violations as reductions
  in the precision requirement, to subsequently adapt batch construction. Through
  extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances learning
  efficiency and flexibility in diverse Bayesian batch active learning and Bayesian
  optimization applications.
