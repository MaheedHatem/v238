title: Identification and Estimation of “Causes of Effects” using Covariate-Mediator
  Information
abstract: 'In this paper, we deal with the evaluation problem of "causes of effects"
  (CoE), which focuses on the likelihood that one event was the cause of another.
  To assess this likelihood, three types of probabilities of causation have been utilized:
  probability of necessity, probability of sufficiency, and probability of necessity
  and sufficiency. However, these usually cannot be estimated, even if "effects of
  causes" (EoC) is estimable from statistical data, regardless of how large the data
  is. To solve this problem, we propose novel identification conditions for CoE, using
  an intermediate variable together with covariate information. Additionally, we also
  propose a new method for estimating CoE that is applicable whenever they are identifiable
  through the proposed identification conditions.'
