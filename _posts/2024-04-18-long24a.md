title: Equation Discovery with Bayesian Spike-and-Slab Priors and Efficient Kernels
software: https://github.com/long-da/KBASS
abstract: Discovering governing equations from data is important to many scientific
  and engineering applications. Despite promising successes, existing methods are
  still challenged by data sparsity and noise issues, both of which are ubiquitous
  in practice. Moreover, state-of-the-art methods lack uncertainty quantification
  and/or are costly in training. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
  equation discovery method based on Kernel learning and BAyesian Spike-and-Slab priors
  (KBASS). We use kernel regression to estimate the target function, which is flexible,
  expressive, and more robust to data sparsity and noises. We combine it with a Bayesian
  spike-and-slab prior — an ideal Bayesian sparse distribution — for effective operator
  selection and uncertainty quantification. We develop an expectation-propagation
  expectation-maximization (EP-EM) algorithm for efficient posterior inference and
  function estimation. To overcome the computational challenge of kernel regression,
  we place the function values on a mesh and induce a Kronecker product construction,
  and we use tensor algebra to enable efficient computation and optimization. We show
  the advantages of KBASS on a list of benchmark ODE and PDE discovery tasks. The
  code is available at \url{https://github.com/long-da/KBASS}.
