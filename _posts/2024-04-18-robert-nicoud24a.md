title: Intrinsic Gaussian Vector Fields on Manifolds
software: https://github.com/DanielRobertNicoud/imv-gps
abstract: 'Various applications ranging from robotics to climate science require modeling
  signals on non-Euclidean domains, such as the sphere. Gaussian process models on
  manifolds have recently been proposed for such tasks, in particular when uncertainty
  quantification is needed. In the manifold setting, vector-valued signals can behave
  very differently from scalar-valued ones, with much of the progress so far focused
  on modeling the latter. The former, however, are crucial for many applications,
  such as modeling wind speeds or force fields of unknown dynamical systems. In this
  paper, we propose novel Gaussian process models for vector-valued signals on manifolds
  that are intrinsically defined and account for the geometry of the space in consideration.
  We provide computational primitives needed to deploy the resulting Hodge-Mat√©rn
  Gaussian vector fields on the two-dimensional sphere and the hypertori. Further,
  we highlight two generalization directions: discrete two-dimensional meshes and
  "ideal" manifolds like hyperspheres, Lie groups, and homogeneous spaces. Finally,
  we show that our Gaussian vector fields constitute considerably more refined inductive
  biases than the extrinsic fields proposed before.'
