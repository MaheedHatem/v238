title: Conformalized Deep Splines for Optimal and Efficient Prediction Sets
software: https://github.com/ndiamant/spice/tree/main
abstract: Uncertainty estimation is critical in high-stakes machine learning applications.
  One effective way to estimate uncertainty is conformal prediction, which can provide
  predictive inference with statistical coverage guarantees. We present a new conformal
  regression method, Spline Prediction Intervals via Conformal Estimation (SPICE),
  that estimates the conditional density using neural- network-parameterized splines.
  We prove universal approximation and optimality results for SPICE, which are empirically
  reflected by our experiments. SPICE is compatible with two different efficient-to-
  compute conformal scores, one designed for size-efficient marginal coverage (SPICE-ND)
  and the other for size-efficient conditional coverage (SPICE-HPD). Results on benchmark
  datasets demonstrate SPICE-ND models achieve the smallest average prediction set
  sizes, including average size reductions of nearly 50% for some datasets compared
  to the next best baseline. SPICE-HPD models achieve the best conditional coverage
  compared to baselines. The SPICE implementation is made available.
