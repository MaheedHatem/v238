title: Multi-resolution Time-Series Transformer for Long-term Forecasting
software: https://github.com/networkslab/MTST
abstract: 'The performance of transformers for time-series forecasting has improved
  significantly. Recent architectures learn complex temporal patterns by segmenting
  a time-series into patches and using the patches as tokens. The patch size controls
  the ability of transformers to learn the temporal patterns at different frequencies:
  shorter patches are effective for learning localized, high-frequency patterns, whereas
  mining long-term seasonalities and trends requires longer patches. Inspired by this
  observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-resolution Time-Series Transformer
  (MTST), which consists of a multi-branch architecture for simultaneous modeling
  of diverse temporal patterns at different resolutions. In contrast to many existing
  time-series transformers, we employ relative positional encoding, which is better
  suited for extracting periodic components at different scales. Extensive experiments
  on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MTST in comparison
  to state-of-the-art forecasting techniques.'
