title: Unsupervised Novelty Detection in Pretrained Representation Space with Locally
  Adapted Likelihood Ratio
software: https://github.com/aahmadian-liu/pretrained-novelty-loclr
abstract: Detecting novelties given unlabeled examples of normal data is a challenging
  task in machine learning, particularly when the novel and normal categories are
  semantically close. Large deep models pretrained on massive datasets can provide
  a rich representation space in which the simple k-nearest neighbor distance works
  as a novelty measure. However, as we show in this paper, the basic k-NN method might
  be insufficient in this context due to ignoring the ’local geometry’ of the distribution
  over representations as well as the impact of irrelevant ’background features’.
  To address this, we propose a fully unsupervised novelty detection approach that
  integrates the flexibility of k-NN with a locally adapted scaling of dimensions
  based on the ’neighbors of nearest neighbor’ and computing a ’likelihood ratio’
  in pretrained (self-supervised) representation spaces. Our experiments with image
  data show the advantage of this method when off-the-shelf vision transformers (e.g.,
  pretrained by DINO) are used as the feature extractor without any fine-tuning.
