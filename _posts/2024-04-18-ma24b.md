title: Directed Hypergraph Representation Learning for Link Prediction
software: https://github.com/mazitong/DHGNN
abstract: 'Link prediction is a critical problem in network structure processing.
  With the prevalence of deep learning, graph-based learning pattern in link prediction
  has been well-proven to successfully apply. However, existing representation-based
  computing paradigms retain some lack in processing complex networks: most methods
  only consider low-order pairwise information or eliminate the direction message,
  which tends to obtain a sub-optimal representation. To tackle the above challenges,
  we propose using directed hypergraph to model the real world and design a directed
  hypergraph neural network framework for data representation learning. Specifically,
  our work can be concluded into two sophisticated aspects: (1) We define the approximate
  Laplacian of the directed hypergraph, and further formulate the convolution operation
  on the directed hypergraph structure, solving the issue of the directed hypergraph
  structure representation learning. (2) By efficiently learning complex information
  from directed hypergraphs to obtain high-quality representations, we develop a framework
  DHGNN for link prediction on directed hypergraph structures. We empirically show
  that the merit of DHGNN lies in its ability to model complex correlations and encode
  information effectively of directed hypergraphs. Extensive experiments conducted
  on multi-field datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DHGNN over various
  state-of-the-art approaches.'
