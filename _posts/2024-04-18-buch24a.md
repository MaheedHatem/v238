title: Simple and scalable algorithms for cluster-aware precision medicine
software: https://github.com/grosenicklab/CARVE-AI
abstract: AI-enabled precision medicine promises a transformational improvement in
  healthcare outcomes. However, training on biomedical data presents significant challenges
  as they are often high dimensional, clustered, and of limited sample size. To overcome
  these challenges, we propose a simple and scalable approach for cluster-aware embedding
  that combines latent factor methods with a convex clustering penalty in a modular
  way. Our novel approach overcomes the complexity and limitations of current joint
  embedding and clustering methods and enables hierarchically clustered principal
  component analysis (PCA), locally linear embedding (LLE), and canonical correlation
  analysis (CCA). Through numerical experiments and real-world examples, we demonstrate
  that our approach outperforms fourteen clustering methods on highly underdetermined
  problems (e.g., with limited sample size) as well as on large sample datasets. Importantly,
  our approach does not require the user to choose the desired number of clusters,
  yields improved model selection if they do, and yields interpretable hierarchically
  clustered embedding dendrograms. Thus, our approach improves significantly on existing
  methods for identifying patient subgroups in multiomics and neuroimaging data and
  enables scalable and interpretable biomarkers for precision medicine.
