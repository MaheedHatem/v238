abstract: 'Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) on large-scale image-caption
  datasets learns representations that can achieve remarkable zero-shot generalization.
  However, such models require a massive amount of pre-training data. Improving the
  quality of the pre-training data has been shown to be much more effective in improving
  CLIPâ€™s performance than increasing its volume. Nevertheless, finding small subsets
  of training data that provably generalize best has remained an open question. In
  this work, we propose the first theoretically rigorous data selection method for
  CLIP. We show that subsets that closely preserve the cross-covariance of the images
  and captions of the full data provably achieve a superior generalization performance.Our
  extensive experiments on ConceptualCaptions3M and ConceptualCaptions12M demonstrate
  that subsets found by \textsc{ClipCov} achieve over 2.7x and 1.4x the accuracy of
  the next best baseline on ImageNet and its shifted versions. Moreover, we show that
  our subsets obtain 1.5x the average accuracy across 11 downstream datasets, of the
  next best baseline. The code is available at: \url{https://github.com/BigML-CS-UCLA/clipcov-data-efficient-clip}.'
