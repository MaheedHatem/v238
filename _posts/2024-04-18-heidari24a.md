title: Adaptive Parametric Prototype Learning for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Classification
abstract: Cross-domain few-shot classification induces a much more challenging problem
  than its in-domain counterpart due to the existence of domain shifts between the
  training and test tasks. In this paper, we develop a novel Adaptive Parametric Prototype
  Learning (APPL) method under the meta-learning convention for cross-domain few-shot
  classification. Different from existing prototypical few-shot methods that use the
  averages of support instances to calculate the class prototypes, we propose to learn
  class prototypes from the concatenated features of the support set in a parametric
  fashion and meta-learn the model by enforcing prototype-based regularization on
  the query set. In addition, we fine-tune the model in the target domain in a transductive
  manner using a weighted-moving-average self-training approach on the query instances.
  We conduct experiments on multiple cross-domain few-shot benchmark datasets. The
  empirical results demonstrate that APPL yields superior performance to many state-of-the-art
  cross-domain few-shot learning methods.
