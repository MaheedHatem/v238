title: 'autoMALA: Locally adaptive Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm'
software: https://github.com/Julia-Tempering/autoMALA-mev
abstract: Selecting the step size for the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA)
  is necessary in order to obtain satisfactory performance. However, finding an adequate
  step size for an arbitrary target distribution can be a difficult task and even
  the best step size can perform poorly in specific regions of the space when the
  target distribution is sufficiently complex. To resolve this issue we introduce
  autoMALA, a new Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on MALA that automatically
  sets its step size at each iteration based on the local geometry of the target distribution.
  We prove that autoMALA has the correct invariant distribution, despite continual
  automatic adjustments of the step size. Our experiments demonstrate that autoMALA
  is competitive with related state-of-the-art MCMC methods, in terms of the number
  of log density evaluations per effective sample, and it outperforms state-of-the-art
  samplers on targets with varying geometries. Furthermore, we find that autoMALA
  tends to find step sizes comparable to optimally-tuned MALA when a fixed step size
  suffices for the whole domain.
