title: 'Stochastic Methods in Variational Inequalities: Ergodicity, Bias and Refinements'
abstract: For min-max optimization and variational inequalities problems (VIPs), Stochastic
  Extragradient (SEG) and Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (SGDA) have emerged as
  preeminent algorithms. Constant step-size versions of SEG/SGDA have gained popularity
  due to several appealing benefits, but their convergence behaviors are complicated
  even in rudimentary bilinear models. Our work elucidates the probabilistic behavior
  of these algorithms and their projected variants, for a wide range of monotone and
  non-monotone VIPs with potentially biased stochastic oracles. By recasting them
  as time-homogeneous Markov Chains, we establish geometric convergence to a unique
  invariant distribution and aymptotic normality. Specializing to min-max optimization,
  we characterize the relationship between the step-size and the induced bias with
  respect to the global solution, which in turns allows for bias refinement via the
  Richardson-Romberg scheme. Our theoretical analysis is corroborated by numerical
  experiments.
