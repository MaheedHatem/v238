title: Formal Verification of Unknown Stochastic Systems via Non-parametric Estimation
abstract: A novel data-driven method for formal verification is proposed to study
  complex systems operating in safety-critical domains. The proposed approach is able
  to formally verify discrete-time stochastic dynamical systems against temporal logic
  specifications only using observation samples and without the knowledge of the model,
  and provide a probabilistic guarantee on the satisfaction of the specification.
  We first propose the theoretical results for using non-parametric estimation to
  estimate an asymptotic upper bound for the \emph{Lipschitz constant} of the stochastic
  system, which can determine a finite abstraction of the system. Our results prove
  that the asymptotic convergence rate of the estimation is $O(n^{-\frac{1}{3+d}})$,
  where $d$ is the dimension of the system and n is the data scale. We then construct
  interval Markov decision processes using two different data-driven methods, namely
  non-parametric estimation and empirical estimation of transition probabilities,
  to perform formal verification against a given temporal logic specification. Multiple
  case studies are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
