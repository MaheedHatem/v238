title: Efficient Model-Based Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning through Greedy
  Mirror Descent
software: https://github.com/biancammoreno/Efficient_MD_CURL
abstract: Many machine learning tasks can be solved by minimizing a convex function
  of an occupancy measure over the policies that generate them. These include reinforcement
  learning, imitation learning, among others. This more general paradigm is called
  the Concave Utility Reinforcement Learning problem (CURL). Since CURL invalidates
  classical Bellman equations, it requires new algorithms. We introduce MD-CURL, a
  new algorithm for CURL in a finite horizon Markov decision process. MD-CURL is inspired
  by mirror descent and uses a non-standard regularization to achieve convergence
  guarantees and a simple closed-form solution, eliminating the need for computationally
  expensive projection steps typically found in mirror descent approaches. We then
  extend CURL to an online learning scenario and present Greedy MD-CURL, a new method
  adapting MD-CURL to an online, episode-based setting with partially unknown dynamics.
  Like MD-CURL, the online version Greedy MD-CURL benefits from low computational
  complexity, while guaranteeing sub-linear or even logarithmic regret, depending
  on the level of information available on the underlying dynamics.
