title: On Convergence in Wasserstein Distance and f-divergence Minimization Problems
software: https://github.com/buyeah1109/convergence-f-divergence-and-wasserstein
abstract: The zero-sum game in generative adversarial networks (GANs) for learning
  the distribution of observed data is known to reduce to the minimization of a divergence
  measure between the underlying and generative models. However, the current theoretical
  understanding of the role of the target divergence in the characteristics of GANsâ€™
  generated samples remains largely inadequate. In this work, we aim to analyze the
  influence of the divergence measure on the local optima and convergence properties
  of divergence minimization problems in learning a multi-modal data distribution.
  We show a mode-seeking f-divergence, e.g. the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence in
  the vanilla GAN, could lead to poor locally optimal solutions missing some underlying
  modes. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the optimization landscape of 1-Wasserstein
  distance in Wasserstein GANs does not suffer from such suboptimal local minima.
  Furthermore, we prove that a randomly-initialized gradient-based optimization of
  the Wasserstein distance will, with high probability, capture all the existing modes.
  We present numerical results on standard image datasets, revealing the success of
  Wasserstein GANs compared to JS-GANs in avoiding suboptimal local optima under a
  mixture model.
