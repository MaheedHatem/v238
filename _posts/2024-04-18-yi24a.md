title: 'Filter, Rank, and Prune: Learning Linear Cyclic Gaussian Graphical Models'
software: https://github.com/soheunyi/frp
abstract: Causal structures in the real world often exhibit cycles naturally due to
  equilibrium, homeostasis, or feedback. However, causal discovery from observational
  studies regarding cyclic models has not been investigated extensively because the
  underlying structure of a linear cyclic structural equation model (SEM) cannot be
  determined solely from observational data. Inspired by the Bayesian information
  Criterion (BIC), we construct a score function that assesses both accuracy and sparsity
  of the structure to determine which linear Gaussian SEM is the best when only observational
  data is given. Then, we formulate a causal discovery problem as an optimization
  problem of the measure and propose the Filter, Rank, and Prune (FRP) method for
  solving it. We empirically demonstrate that our method outperforms competitive cyclic
  causal discovery baselines.
