title: Adaptive importance sampling for heavy-tailed distributions via $α$-divergence
  minimization
software: https://github.com/nicola144/ais-heavy-tails
abstract: Adaptive importance sampling (AIS) algorithms are widely used to approximate
  expectations with respect to complicated target probability distributions. When
  the target has heavy tails, existing AIS algorithms can provide inconsistent estimators
  or exhibit slow convergence, as they often neglect the target’s tail behaviour.
  To avoid this pitfall, we propose an AIS algorithm that approximates the target
  by Student-t proposal distributions. We adapt location and scale parameters by matching
  the escort moments - which are defined even for heavy-tailed distributions - of
  the target and proposal. These updates minimize the $\alpha$-divergence between
  the target and the proposal, thereby connecting with variational inference. We then
  show that the $\alpha$-divergence can be approximated by a generalized notion of
  effective sample size and leverage this new perspective to adapt the tail parameter
  with Bayesian optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through
  applications to synthetic targets and a Bayesian Student-t regression task on a
  real example with clinical trial data.
