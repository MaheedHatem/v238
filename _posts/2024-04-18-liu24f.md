title: Supervised Feature Selection via Ensemble Gradient Information from Sparse
  Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/KaitingLiu/GradEnFS
abstract: Feature selection algorithms aim to select a subset of informative features
  from a dataset to reduce the data dimensionality, consequently saving resource consumption
  and improving the model’s performance and interpretability. In recent years, feature
  selection based on neural networks has become a new trend, demonstrating superiority
  over traditional feature selection methods. However, most existing methods use dense
  neural networks to detect informative features, which requires significant computational
  and memory overhead. In this paper, taking inspiration from the successful application
  of local sensitivity analysis on neural networks, we propose a novel resource-efficient
  supervised feature selection algorithm based on sparse multi-layer perceptron called
  “GradEnFS". By utilizing the gradient information of various sparse models from
  different training iterations, our method successfully detects the informative feature
  subset. We performed extensive experiments on nine classification datasets spanning
  various domains to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The results demonstrate
  that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
  selecting informative features while saving resource consumption substantially.
  Moreover, we show that using a sparse neural network for feature selection not only
  alleviates resource consumption but also has a significant advantage over other
  methods when performing feature selection on noisy datasets.
