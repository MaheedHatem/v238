title: Adaptive Compression in Federated Learning via Side Information
software: https://github.com/FrancescoPase/Federated-KLMS
abstract: The high communication cost of sending model updates from the clients to
  the server is a significant bottleneck for scalable federated learning (FL). Among
  existing approaches, state-of-the-art bitrate-accuracy tradeoffs have been achieved
  using stochastic compression methods – in which the client n sends a sample from
  a client-only probability distribution $q_{\phi^{(n)}}$, and the server estimates
  the mean of the clients’ distributions using these samples. However, such methods
  do not take full advantage of the FL setup where the server, throughout the training
  process, has side information in the form of a global distribution $p_{\theta}$
  that is close to the client-only distribution $q_{\phi^{(n)}}$ in Kullback-Leibler
  (KL) divergence. In this work, we exploit this \emph{closeness} between the clients’
  distributions $q_{\phi^{(n)}}$’s and the side information $p_{\theta}$ at the server,
  and propose a framework that requires approximately $D_{KL}(q_{\phi^{(n)}}|| p_{\theta})$
  bits of communication. We show that our method can be integrated into many existing
  stochastic compression frameworks to attain the same (and often higher) test accuracy
  with up to 82 times smaller bitrate than the prior work – corresponding to 2,650
  times overall compression.
