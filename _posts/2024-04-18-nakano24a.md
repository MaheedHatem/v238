title: Warped Diffusion for Latent Differentiation Inference
software: https://github.com/masahironakanopr/warped-diffusion
abstract: This paper proposes a Bayesian nonparametric diffusion model with a black-box
  warping function represented by a Gaussian process to infer potential diffusion
  structures latent in observed data, such as differentiation mechanisms of living
  cells and phylogenetic evolution processes of media information. In general, the
  task of inferring latent differentiation structures is very difficult to handle
  due to two interrelated settings. One is that the conversion mechanism between hidden
  structure and often higher dimensional observations is unknown (and is a complex
  mechanism). The other is that the topology of the hidden diffuse structure itself
  is unknown. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a BNP-based strategy as a natural
  way to deal with these two challenging settings simultaneously. Specifically, as
  an extension of the Gaussian process latent variable model, we propose a model in
  which the black box transformation from latent variable space to observed data space
  is represented by a Gaussian process, and introduce a BNP diffusion model for the
  latent variable space. We show its application to the visualization of the diffusion
  structure of media information and to the task of inferring cell differentiation
  structure from single-cell gene expression levels.
