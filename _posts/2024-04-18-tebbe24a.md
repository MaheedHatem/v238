title: Efficiently Computable Safety Bounds for Gaussian Processes in Active Learning
software: https://github.com/joerntebbe/SafetyBounds4GPinAL
abstract: Active learning of physical systems must commonly respect practical safety
  constraints, which restricts the exploration of the design space. Gaussian Processes
  (GPs) and their calibrated uncertainty estimations are widely used for this purpose.
  In many technical applications the design space is explored via continuous trajectories,
  along which the safety needs to be assessed. This is particularly challenging for
  strict safety requirements in GP methods, as it employs computationally expensive
  Monte Carlo sampling of high quantiles. We address these challenges by providing
  provable safety bounds based on the adaptively sampled median of the supremum of
  the posterior GP. Our method significantly reduces the number of samples required
  for estimating high safety probabilities, resulting in faster evaluation without
  sacrificing accuracy and exploration speed. The effectiveness of our safe active
  learning approach is demonstrated through extensive simulations and validated using
  a real-world engine example.
