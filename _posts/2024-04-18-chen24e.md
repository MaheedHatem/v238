title: Non-Convex Joint Community Detection and Group Synchronization via Generalized
  Power Method
abstract: This paper proposes a Generalized Power Method (GPM) to simultaneously solve
  the joint problem of community detection and group synchronization in a direct non-convex
  manner, in contrast to the existing method of semidefinite programming (SDP). Under
  a natural extension of stochastic block model (SBM), our theoretical analysis proves
  that the proposed algorithm is able to exactly recover the ground truth in $O(n\log^2
  n)$ time for problems of size $n$, sharply outperforming the $O(n^{3.5})$ runtime
  of SDP. Moreover, we give a lower bound of model parameters as a sufficient condition
  for the exact recovery of GPM. The new bound breaches the information-theoretic
  limit for pure community detection under SBM, thus demonstrating the superiority
  of our simultaneous optimization algorithm over any two-stage method that performs
  the two tasks in succession. We also conduct numerical experiments on GPM and SDP
  to corroborate our theoretical analysis.
