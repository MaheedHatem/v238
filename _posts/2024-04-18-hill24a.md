title: Boundary-Aware Uncertainty for Feature Attribution Explainers
software: https://github.com/davinhill/GPEC
abstract: Post-hoc explanation methods have become a critical tool for understanding
  black-box classifiers in high-stakes applications. However, high-performing classifiers
  are often highly nonlinear and can exhibit complex behavior around the decision
  boundary, leading to brittle or misleading local explanations. Therefore there is
  an impending need to quantify the uncertainty of such explanation methods in order
  to understand when explanations are trustworthy. In this work we propose the Gaussian
  Process Explanation unCertainty (GPEC) framework, which generates a unified uncertainty
  estimate combining decision boundary-aware uncertainty with explanation function
  approximation uncertainty. We introduce a novel geodesic-based kernel, which captures
  the complexity of the target black-box decision boundary. We show theoretically
  that the proposed kernel similarity increases with decision boundary complexity.
  The proposed framework is highly flexible; it can be used with any black-box classifier
  and feature attribution method. Empirical results on multiple tabular and image
  datasets show that the GPEC uncertainty estimate improves understanding of explanations
  as compared to existing methods.
