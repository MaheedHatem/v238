title: Adaptive Federated Minimax Optimization with Lower Complexities
abstract: Federated learning is a popular distributed and privacy-preserving learning
  paradigm in machine learning. Recently, some federated learning algorithms have
  been proposed to solve the distributed minimax problems. However, these federated
  minimax algorithms still suffer from high gradient or communication complexity.
  Meanwhile, few algorithm focuses on using adaptive learning rate to accelerate these
  algorithms. To fill this gap, in the paper, we study a class of nonconvex minimax
  optimization, and propose an efficient adaptive federated minimax optimization algorithm
  (i.e., AdaFGDA) to solve these distributed minimax problems. Specifically, our AdaFGDA
  builds on the momentum-based variance reduced and local-SGD techniques, and it can
  flexibly incorporate various adaptive learning rates by using the unified adaptive
  matrices. Theoretically, we provide a solid convergence analysis framework for our
  AdaFGDA algorithm under non-i.i.d. setting. Moreover, we prove our AdaFGDA algorithm
  obtains a lower gradient (i.e., stochastic first-order oracle, SFO) complexity of
  $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ with lower communication complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$
  in finding $\epsilon$-stationary point of the nonconvex minimax problems. Experimentally,
  we conduct some experiments on the deep AUC maximization and robust neural network
  training tasks to verify efficiency of our algorithms.
