title: On the Privacy of Selection Mechanisms with Gaussian Noise
software: https://github.com/jlebensold/pure-dp-gaussian-mech
abstract: Report Noisy Max and Above Threshold are two classical differentially private
  (DP) selection mechanisms. Their output is obtained by adding noise to a sequence
  of low-sensitivity queries and reporting the identity of the query whose (noisy)
  answer satisfies a certain condition. Pure DP guarantees for these mechanisms are
  easy to obtain when Laplace noise is added to the queries. On the other hand, when
  instantiated using Gaussian noise, standard analyses only yield approximate DP guarantees
  despite the fact that the outputs of these mechanisms lie in a discrete space. In
  this work, we revisit the analysis of Report Noisy Max and Above Threshold with
  Gaussian noise and show that, under the additional assumption that the underlying
  queries are bounded, it is possible to provide pure ex-ante DP bounds for Report
  Noisy Max and pure ex-post DP bounds for Above Threshold. The resulting bounds are
  tight and depend on closed-form expressions that can be numerically evaluated using
  standard methods. Empirically we find these lead to tighter privacy accounting in
  the high privacy, low data regime. Further, we propose a simple privacy filter for
  composing pure ex-post DP guarantees, and use it to derive a fully adaptive Gaussian
  Sparse Vector Technique mechanism. Finally, we provide experiments on mobility and
  energy consumption datasets demonstrating that our Sparse Vector Technique is practically
  competitive with previous approaches and requires less hyper-parameter tuning.
