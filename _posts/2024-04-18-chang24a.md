title: Probabilistic Modeling for Sequences of Sets in Continuous-Time
software: https://github.com/yuxinc17/set_valued_mtpp
abstract: Neural marked temporal point processes have been a valuable addition to
  the existing toolbox of statistical parametric models for continuous-time event
  data. These models are useful for sequences where each event is associated with
  a single item (a single type of event or a “mark”)—but such models are not suited
  for the practical situation where each event is associated with a set of items.
  In this work, we develop a general framework for modeling set-valued data in continuous-time,
  compatible with any intensity-based recurrent neural point process model. In addition,
  we develop inference methods that can use such models to answer probabilistic queries
  such as “the probability of item A being observed before item B,” conditioned on
  sequence history. Computing exact answers for such queries is generally intractable
  for neural models due to both the continuous-time nature of the problem setting
  and the combinatorially-large space of potential outcomes for each event. To address
  this, we develop a class of importance sampling methods for querying with set-based
  sequences and demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency over direct
  sampling via systematic experiments with four real-world datasets. We also illustrate
  how to use this framework to perform model selection using likelihoods that do not
  involve one-step-ahead prediction.
