title: Learning to Rank for Optimal Treatment Allocation Under Resource Constraints
software: https://github.com/MLD3/Learning-to-Rank-for-Optimal-Treatment-Allocation-Under-Resource-Constraints
abstract: Current causal inference approaches for estimating conditional average treatment
  effects (CATEs) often prioritize accuracy. However, in resource constrained settings,
  decision makers may only need a ranking of individuals based on their estimated
  CATE. In these scenarios, exact CATE estimation may be an unnecessarily challenging
  task, particularly when the underlying function is difficult to learn. In this work,
  we study the relationship between CATE estimation and optimizing for CATE ranking,
  demonstrating that optimizing for ranking may be more appropriate than optimizing
  for accuracy in certain settings. Guided by our analysis, we propose an approach
  to directly optimize for rankings of individuals to inform treatment assignment
  that aims to maximize benefit. Our tree-based approach maximizes the expected benefit
  of the treatment assignment using a novel splitting criteria. In an empirical case-study
  across synthetic datasets, our approach leads to better treatment assignments compared
  to CATE estimation methods as measured by expected total benefit. By providing a
  practical and efficient approach to learning a CATE ranking, this work offers an
  important step towards bridging the gap between CATE estimation techniques and their
  downstream applications.
