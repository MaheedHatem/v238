title: Optimal estimation of Gaussian (poly)trees
software: https://github.com/YohannaWANG/Polytree
abstract: We develop optimal algorithms for learning undirected Gaussian trees and
  directed Gaussian polytrees from data. We consider both problems of distribution
  learning (i.e. in KL distance) and structure learning (i.e. exact recovery). The
  first approach is based on the Chow-Liu algorithm, and learns an optimal tree-structured
  distribution efficiently. The second approach is a modification of the PC algorithm
  for polytrees that uses partial correlation as a conditional independence tester
  for constraint-based structure learning. We derive explicit finite-sample guarantees
  for both approaches, and show that both approaches are optimal by deriving matching
  lower bounds. Additionally, we conduct numerical experiments to compare the performance
  of various algorithms, providing further insights and empirical evidence.
