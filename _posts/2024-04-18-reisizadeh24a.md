title: EM for Mixture of Linear Regression with Clustered Data
abstract: Modern data-driven and distributed learning frameworks deal with diverse
  massive data generated by clients spread across heterogeneous environments. Indeed,
  data heterogeneity is a major bottleneck in scaling up many distributed learning
  paradigms. In many settings however, heterogeneous data may be generated in clusters
  with shared structures, as is the case in several applications such as federated
  learning where a common latent variable governs the distribution of all the samples
  generated by a client. It is therefore natural to ask how the underlying clustered
  structures in distributed data can be exploited to improve learning schemes. In
  this paper, we tackle this question in the special case of estimating $d$-dimensional
  parameters of a two-component mixture of linear regressions problem where each of
  $m$ nodes generates $n$ samples with a shared latent variable. We employ the well-known
  Expectation-Maximization (EM) method to estimate the maximum likelihood parameters
  from m batches of dependent samples each containing n measurements. Discarding the
  clustered structure in the mixture model, EM is known to require $O(\log(mn/d))$
  iterations to reach the statistical accuracy of $O(\sqrt{d/(mn)}$). In contrast,
  we show that if initialized properly, EM on the structured data requires only $O(1)$
  iterations to reach the same statistical accuracy, as long as m grows up as $e^{o(n)}$.
  Our analysis establishes and combines novel asymptotic optimization and generalization
  guarantees for population and empirical EM with dependent samples, which may be
  of independent interest.
