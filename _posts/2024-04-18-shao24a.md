title: Nonparametric Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference with Spline Approximation
software: https://github.com/TianshuFeng/SADVI_AISTATS2024
abstract: Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) is efficient in learning
  probabilistic models. Classic ADVI relies on the parametric approach to approximate
  the posterior. In this paper, we develop a spline-based nonparametric approximation
  approach that enables flexible posterior approximation for distributions with complicated
  structures, such as skewness, multimodality, and bounded support. Compared with
  widely-used nonparametric variational inference methods, the proposed method is
  easy to implement and adaptive to various data structures. By adopting the spline
  approximation, we derive a lower bound of the importance weighted autoencoder and
  establish the asymptotic consistency. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of
  the proposed method in approximating complex posterior distributions and improving
  the performance of generative models with incomplete data.
