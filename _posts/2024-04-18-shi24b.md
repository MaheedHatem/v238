title: Adaptive and non-adaptive minimax rates for weighted Laplacian-Eigenmap based
  nonparametric regression
abstract: We show both adaptive and non-adaptive minimax rates of convergence for
  a family of weighted Laplacian-Eigenmap based nonparametric regression methods,
  when the true regression function belongs to a Sobolev space and the sampling density
  is bounded from above and below. The adaptation methodology is based on extensions
  of Lepskiâ€™s method and is over both the smoothness parameter ($s\in\mathbb{N}_{+}$)
  and the norm parameter ($M>0$) determining the constraints on the Sobolev space.
  Our results extend the non-adaptive result in Green et al., (2023), established
  for a specific normalized graph Laplacian, to a wide class of weighted Laplacian
  matrices used in practice, including the unnormalized Laplacian and random walk
  Laplacian.
