title: Online Learning of Decision Trees with Thompson Sampling
software: https://github.com/Chaoukia/Thompson-Sampling-Decision-Trees
abstract: Decision Trees are prominent prediction models for interpretable Machine
  Learning. They have been thoroughly researched, mostly in the batch setting with
  a fixed labelled dataset, leading to popular algorithms such as C4.5, ID3 and CART.
  Unfortunately, these methods are of heuristic nature, they rely on greedy splits
  offering no guarantees of global optimality and often leading to unnecessarily complex
  and hard-to-interpret Decision Trees. Recent breakthroughs addressed this suboptimality
  issue in the batch setting, but no such work has considered the online setting with
  data arriving in a stream. To this end, we devise a new Monte Carlo Tree Search
  algorithm, Thompson Sampling Decision Trees (TSDT), able to produce optimal Decision
  Trees in an online setting. We analyse our algorithm and prove its almost sure convergence
  to the optimal tree. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to validate our
  findings empirically. The proposed TSDT outperforms existing algorithms on several
  benchmarks, all while presenting the practical advantage of being tailored to the
  online setting.
