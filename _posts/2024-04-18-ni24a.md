title: Mixture-of-Linear-Experts for Long-term Time Series Forecasting
software: https://github.com/RogerNi/MoLE
abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) aims to predict future values of
  a time series given the past values. The current state-of-the-art (SOTA) on this
  problem is attained in some cases by linear-centric models, which primarily feature
  a linear mapping layer. However, due to their inherent simplicity, they are not
  able to adapt their prediction rules to periodic changes in time series patterns.
  To address this challenge, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts-style augmentation for
  linear-centric models and propose Mixture-of-Linear-Experts (MoLE). Instead of training
  a single model, MoLE trains multiple linear-centric models (i.e., experts) and a
  router model that weighs and mixes their outputs. While the entire framework is
  trained end-to-end, each expert learns to specialize in a specific temporal pattern,
  and the router model learns to compose the experts adaptively. Experiments show
  that MoLE reduces forecasting error of linear-centric models, including DLinear,
  RLinear, and RMLP, in over 78% of the datasets and settings we evaluated. By using
  MoLE existing linear-centric models can achieve SOTA LTSF results in 68% of the
  experiments that PatchTST reports and we compare to, whereas existing single-head
  linear-centric models achieve SOTA results in only 25% of cases.
