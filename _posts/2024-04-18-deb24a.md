title: 'Think Before You Duel: Understanding Complexities of Preference Learning under
  Constrained Resources'
software: https://github.com/rohandeb24/Dueling-Bandits-with-Constraints
abstract: We consider the problem of reward maximization in the dueling bandit setup
  along with constraints on resource consumption. As in the classic dueling bandits,
  at each round the learner has to choose a pair of items from a set of $K$ items
  and observe a relative feedback for the current pair. Additionally, for both items,
  the learner also observes a vector of resource consumptions. The objective of the
  learner is to maximize the cumulative reward, while ensuring that the total consumption
  of any resource is within the allocated budget. We show that due to the relative
  nature of the feedback, the problem is more difficult than its bandit counterpart
  and that without further assumptions the problem is not learnable from a regret
  minimization perspective. Thereafter, by exploiting assumptions on the available
  budget, we provide an EXP3 based dueling algorithm that also considers the associated
  consumptions and show that it achieves an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\big({\frac{OPT^{(b)}}{B}}+1\big)K^{1/3}T^{2/3}\right)$
  regret, where $OPT^{(b)}$ is the optimal value and $B$ is the available budget.
  Finally, we provide numerical simulations to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed
  method.
