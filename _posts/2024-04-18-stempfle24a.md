title: 'MINTY: Rule-based models that minimize the need for imputing features with
  missing values'
software: https://github.com/Healthy-AI/minty
abstract: Rule models are often preferred in prediction tasks with tabular inputs
  as they can be easily interpreted using natural language and provide predictive
  performance on par with more complex models. However, most rule modelsâ€™ predictions
  are undefined or ambiguous when some inputs are missing, forcing users to rely on
  statistical imputation models or heuristics like zero imputation, undermining the
  interpretability of the models. In this work, we propose fitting concise yet precise
  rule models that learn to avoid relying on features with missing values and, therefore,
  limit their reliance on imputation at test time. We develop MINTY, a method that
  learns rules in the form of disjunctions between variables that act as replacements
  for each other when one or more is missing. This results in a sparse linear rule
  model, regularized to have small dependence on features with missing values, that
  allows a trade-off between goodness of fit, interpretability, and robustness to
  missing values at test time. We demonstrate the value of MINTY in experiments using
  synthetic and real-world data sets and find its predictive performance comparable
  or favorable to baselines, with smaller reliance on features with missing values.
