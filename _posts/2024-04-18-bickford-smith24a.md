title: Making Better Use of Unlabelled Data in Bayesian Active Learning
software: https://github.com/fbickfordsmith/epig
abstract: Fully supervised models are predominant in Bayesian active learning. We
  argue that their neglect of the information present in unlabelled data harms not
  just predictive performance but also decisions about what data to acquire. Our proposed
  solution is a simple framework for semi-supervised Bayesian active learning. We
  find it produces better-performing models than either conventional Bayesian active
  learning or semi-supervised learning with randomly acquired data. It is also easier
  to scale up than the conventional approach. As well as supporting a shift towards
  semi-supervised models, our findings highlight the importance of studying models
  and acquisition methods in conjunction.
