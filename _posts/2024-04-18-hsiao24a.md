title: Surrogate Bayesian Networks for Approximating Evolutionary Games
abstract: Spatial evolutionary games are used to model large systems of interacting
  agents. In earlier work, a method was developed using Bayesian Networks to approximate
  the population dynamics in these games. One of the advantages of the Bayesian Network
  modeling approach is that it is possible to smoothly adjust the size of the network
  to get more accurate approximations. However, scaling the method up can be intractable
  if the number of strategies in the evolutionary game increases. In this paper, we
  propose a new method for computing more accurate approximations by using surrogate
  Bayesian Networks. Instead of computing inference on larger networks directly, we
  perform inference on a much smaller surrogate network extended with parameters that
  exploit the symmetry inherent to the domain. We learn the parameters on the surrogate
  network using KL-divergence as the loss function. We illustrate the value of this
  method empirically through a comparison on several evolutionary games.
