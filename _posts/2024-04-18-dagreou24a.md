title: A Lower Bound and a Near-Optimal Algorithm for Bilevel Empirical Risk Minimization
software: https://github.com/benchopt/benchmark_bilevel
abstract: Bilevel optimization problems, which are problems where two optimization
  problems are nested, have more and more applications in machine learning. In many
  practical cases, the upper and the lower objectives correspond to empirical risk
  minimization problems and therefore have a sum structure. In this context, we propose
  a bilevel extension of the celebrated SARAH algorithm. We demonstrate that the algorithm
  requires $O((n+m)^{1/2}\epsilon^{-1})$ oracle calls to achieve $\epsilon$-stationarity
  with $n+m$ the total number of samples, which improves over all previous bilevel
  algorithms. Moreover, we provide a lower bound on the number of oracle calls required
  to get an approximate stationary point of the objective function of the bilevel
  problem. This lower bound is attained by our algorithm, making it optimal in terms
  of sample complexity.
