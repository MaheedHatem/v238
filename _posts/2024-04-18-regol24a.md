title: Categorical Generative Model Evaluation via Synthetic Distribution Coarsening
software: https://github.com/networkslab/eval_cat
abstract: As we expect to see a rapid integration of generative models in our day
  to day lives, the development of rigorous methods of evaluation and analysis for
  generative models has never been more pressing. Multiple works have highlighted
  the shortcomings of widely used metrics and exposed how they fail to behave as expected
  in some settings. So far, the response has been to use a variety of metrics that
  target different desirable and interpretable properties such as fidelity, diversity,
  and authenticity, to obtain a clearer picture of a generative modelâ€™s capabilities.
  These methods mainly focus on ordinal data and they all suffer from the same unavoidable
  issues stemming from estimating quantities of high-dimensional data from a limited
  number of samples. We propose to take an alternative approach and to return to the
  synthetic data setting where the ground truth is explicit and known. We focus on
  nominal categorical data and introduce an evaluation method that can scale to the
  high-dimensional settings often encountered in practice. Our method involves successively
  binning the large space to obtain smaller probability spaces and coarser distributions
  where meaningful statistical estimates can be obtained. This allows us to provide
  probabilistic guarantees and sample complexities and we illustrate how our method
  can be applied to distinguish between the capabilities of several state-of-the-art
  categorical models.
