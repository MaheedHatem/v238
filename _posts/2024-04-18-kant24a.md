title: Identifiability of Product of Experts Models
abstract: 'Product of experts (PoE) are layered networks in which the value at each
  node is an AND (or product) of the values (possibly negated) at its inputs. These
  were introduced as a neural network architecture that can efficiently learn to generate
  high-dimensional data which satisfy many low-dimensional constraints-thereby allowing
  each individual expert to perform a simple task. PoEs have found a variety of applications
  in learning. We study the problem of identifiability of a product of experts model
  having a layer of binary latent variables, and a layer of binary observables that
  are iid conditional on the latents. The previous best upper bound on the number
  of observables needed to identify the model was exponential in the number of parameters.
  We show: (a) When the latents are uniformly distributed, the model is identifiable
  with a number of observables equal to the number of parameters (and hence best possible).
  (b) In the more general case of arbitrarily distributed latents, the model is identifiable
  for a number of observables that is still linear in the number of parameters (and
  within a factor of two of best-possible). The proofs rely on root interlacing phenomena
  for some special three-term recurrences.'
