title: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting By Graph Attention Networks With Theoretical
  Guarantees
software: https://github.com/zzh237/Weight-bounded-GAT
abstract: 'Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) aims to predict future values
  of multiple variables based on past values of multivariate time series, and has
  been applied in fields including traffic flow prediction, stock price forecasting,
  and anomaly detection. Capturing the inter-dependencies among multiple series poses
  one significant challenge to MTSF. Recent works have considered modeling the correlated
  series as graph nodes and using graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches with
  attention mechanisms added to improve the test prediction accuracy, however, none
  of them have theoretical guarantees regarding the generalization error. In this
  paper, we develop a new norm-bounded graph attention network (GAT) for MTSF by upper-bounding
  the Frobenius norm of weights in each layer of the GAT model to enhance performance.
  We theoretically establish that the generalization error bound for our model is
  associated with various components of GAT models: the number of attention heads,
  the maximum number of neighbors, the upper bound of the Frobenius norm of the weight
  matrix in each layer, and the norm of the input features. Empirically, we investigate
  the impact of different components of GAT models on the generalization performance
  of MTSF on real data. Our experiment verifies our theoretical findings. We compare
  with multiple prior frequently cited graph-based methods for MTSF using real data
  sets and the experiment results show our method can achieve the best performance
  for MTSF. Our method provides novel perspectives for improving the generalization
  performance of MTSF, and our theoretical guarantees give substantial implications
  for designing graph-based methods with attention mechanisms for MTSF.'
