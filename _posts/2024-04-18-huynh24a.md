title: 'DAGnosis: Localized Identification of Data Inconsistencies using Structures'
software: https://github.com/nicolashuynh/DAGNOSIS
abstract: 'Identification and appropriate handling of inconsistencies in data at deployment
  time is crucial to reliably use machine learning models. While recent data-centric
  methods are able to identify such inconsistencies with respect to the training set,
  they suffer from two key limitations: (1) suboptimality in settings where features
  exhibit statistical independencies, due to their usage of compressive representations
  and (2) lack of localization to pin-point why a sample might be flagged as inconsistent,
  which is important to guide future data collection. We solve these two fundamental
  limitations using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to encode the training set’s features
  probability distribution and independencies as a structure. Our method, called DAGnosis,
  leverages these structural interactions to bring valuable and insightful data-centric
  conclusions. DAGnosis unlocks the localization of the causes of inconsistencies
  on a DAG, an aspect overlooked by previous approaches. Moreover, we show empirically
  that leveraging these interactions (1) leads to more accurate conclusions in detecting
  inconsistencies, as well as (2) provides more detailed insights into why some samples
  are flagged.'
