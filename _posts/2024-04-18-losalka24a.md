title: No-Regret Algorithms for Safe Bayesian Optimization with Monotonicity Constraints
software: https://github.com/arpanlosalka/m-safeopt
abstract: We consider the problem of sequentially maximizing an unknown function $f$
  over a set of actions of the form $(s, x)$, where the selected actions must satisfy
  a safety constraint with respect to an unknown safety function $g$. We model $f$
  and $g$ as lying in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which facilitates
  the use of Gaussian process methods. While existing works for this setting have
  provided algorithms that are guaranteed to identify a near-optimal safe action,
  the problem of attaining low cumulative regret has remained largely unexplored,
  with a key challenge being that expanding the safe region can incur high regret.
  To address this challenge, we show that if $g$ is monotone with respect to just
  the single variable $s$ (with no such constraint on $f$), sublinear regret becomes
  achievable with our proposed algorithm. In addition, we show that a modified version
  of our algorithm is able to attain sublinear regret (for suitably defined notions
  of regret) for the task of finding a near-optimal $s$ corresponding to every $x$,
  as opposed to only finding the global safe optimum. Our findings are supported with
  empirical evaluations on various objective and safety functions.
