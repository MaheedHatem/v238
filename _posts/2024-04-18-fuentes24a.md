title: 'Joint Selection: Adaptively Incorporating Public Information for Private Synthetic
  Data'
software: https://github.com/Miguel-Fuentes/JAM_AiStats
abstract: Mechanisms for generating differentially private synthetic data based on
  marginals and graphical models have been successful in a wide range of settings.
  However, one limitation of these methods is their inability to incorporate public
  data. Initializing a data generating model by pre-training on public data has shown
  to improve the quality of synthetic data, but this technique is not applicable when
  model structure is not determined a priori. We develop the mechanism JAM-PGM, which
  expands the adaptive measurements framework to jointly select between measuring
  public data and private data. This technique allows for public data to be included
  in a graphical-model-based mechanism. We show that JAM-PGM is able to outperform
  both publicly assisted and non publicly assisted synthetic data generation mechanisms
  even when the public data distribution is biased.
