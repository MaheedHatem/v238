title: Proving Linear Mode Connectivity of Neural Networks via Optimal Transport
software: https://github.com/damienferbach/OT_LMC
abstract: The energy landscape of high-dimensional non-convex optimization problems
  is crucial to understanding the effectiveness of modern deep neural network architectures.
  Recent works have experimentally shown that two different solutions found after
  two runs of a stochastic training are often connected by very simple continuous
  paths (e.g., linear) modulo a permutation of the weights. In this paper, we provide
  a framework theoretically explaining this empirical observation. Based on convergence
  rates in Wasserstein distance of empirical measures, we show that, with high probability,
  two wide enough two-layer neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent
  are linearly connected. Additionally, we express upper and lower bounds on the width
  of each layer of two deep neural networks with independent neuron weights to be
  linearly connected. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the validity of our approach
  by showing how the dimension of the support of the weight distribution of neurons,
  which dictates Wasserstein convergence rates is correlated with linear mode connectivity.
