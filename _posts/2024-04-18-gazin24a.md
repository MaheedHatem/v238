title: Transductive conformal inference with adaptive scores
software: https://github.com/ulyssegazin/TransductiveAdaptive_CP
abstract: 'Conformal inference is a fundamental and versatile tool that provides distribution-free
  guarantees for many machine learning tasks. We consider the transductive setting,
  where decisions are made on a test sample of $m$ new points, giving rise to $m$
  conformal $p$-values. While classical results only concern their marginal distribution,
  we show that their joint distribution follows a PÃ³lya urn model, and establish a
  concentration inequality for their empirical distribution function. The results
  hold for arbitrary exchangeable scores, including adaptive ones that can use the
  covariates of the test${+}$calibration samples at training stage for increased accuracy.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of these theoretical results through uniform, in-probability
  guarantees for two machine learning tasks of current interest: interval prediction
  for transductive transfer learning and novelty detection based on two-class classification.'
