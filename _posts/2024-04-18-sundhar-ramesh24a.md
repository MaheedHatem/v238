title: Distributionally Robust Model-based Reinforcement Learning with Large State
  Spaces
software: https://github.com/rsshyam/MVR-RFQI
abstract: Three major challenges in reinforcement learning are the complex dynamical
  systems with large state spaces, the costly data acquisition processes, and the
  deviation of real-world dynamics from the training environment deployment. To overcome
  these issues, we study distributionally robust Markov decision processes with continuous
  state spaces under the widely used Kullback-Leibler, chi-square, and total variation
  uncertainty sets. We propose a model-based approach that utilizes Gaussian Processes
  and the maximum variance reduction algorithm to efficiently learn multi-output nominal
  transition dynamics, leveraging access to a generative model (i.e., simulator).
  We further demonstrate the statistical sample complexity of the proposed method
  for different uncertainty sets. These complexity bounds are independent of the number
  of states and extend beyond linear dynamics, ensuring the effectiveness of our approach
  in identifying near-optimal distributionally-robust policies. The proposed method
  can be further combined with other model-free distributionally robust reinforcement
  learning methods to obtain a near-optimal robust policy. Experimental results demonstrate
  the robustness of our algorithm to distributional shifts and its superior performance
  in terms of the number of samples needed.
