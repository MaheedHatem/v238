title: Sequential learning of the Pareto front for multi-objective bandits
software: https://github.com/elise-crepon/sequential-pareto-learning-experiments
abstract: We study the problem of sequential learning of the Pareto front in multi-objective
  multi-armed bandits. An agent is faced with $K$ possible arms to pull. At each turn
  she picks one, and receives a vector-valued reward. When she thinks she has enough
  information to identify the Pareto front of the different arm means, she stops the
  game and gives an answer. We are interested in designing algorithms such that the
  answer given is correct with probability at least $1-\delta$. Our main contribution
  is an efficient implementation of an algorithm achieving the optimal sample complexity
  when the risk $\delta$ is small. With $K$ arms in $d$ dimensions, $p$ of which are
  in the Pareto set, the algorithm runs in time $O(K p^d)$ per round.
