title: Symmetric Equilibrium Learning of VAEs
software: https://github.com/dschles70/symvae-aistats2024
abstract: We view variational autoencoders (VAE) as decoder-encoder pairs, which map
  distributions in the data space to distributions in the latent space and vice versa.
  The standard learning approach for VAEs is the maximisation of the evidence lower
  bound (ELBO). It is asymmetric in that it aims at learning a latent variable model
  while using the encoder as an auxiliary means only. Moreover, it requires a closed
  form a-priori latent distribution. This limits its applicability in more complex
  scenarios, such as general semi-supervised learning and employing complex generative
  models as priors. We propose a Nash equilibrium learning approach, which is symmetric
  with respect to the encoder and decoder and allows learning VAEs in situations where
  both the data and the latent distributions are accessible only by sampling. The
  flexibility and simplicity of this approach allows its application to a wide range
  of learning scenarios and downstream tasks.
