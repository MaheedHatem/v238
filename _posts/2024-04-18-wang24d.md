title: Near-Optimal Convex Simple Bilevel Optimization with a Bisection Method
software: https://github.com/XuShi22/BisecBiO
abstract: This paper studies a class of simple bilevel optimization problems where
  we minimize a composite convex function at the upper-level subject to a composite
  convex lower-level problem. Existing methods either provide asymptotic guarantees
  for the upper-level objective or attain slow sublinear convergence rates. We propose
  a bisection algorithm to find a solution that is $\epsilon_f$-optimal for the upper-level
  objective and $\epsilon_g$-optimal for the lower-level objective. In each iteration,
  the binary search narrows the interval by assessing inequality system feasibility.
  Under mild conditions, the total operation complexity of our method is ${{\mathcal{O}}}\left(\max\{\sqrt{L_{f_1}/\epsilon_f},\sqrt{L_{g_1}/\epsilon_g}\}
  \right)$. Here, a unit operation can be a function evaluation, gradient evaluation,
  or the invocation of the proximal mapping, $L_{f_1}$ and $L_{g_1}$ are the Lipschitz
  constants of the upper- and lower-level objectivesâ€™ smooth components, and ${\mathcal{O}}$
  hides logarithmic terms. Our approach achieves a near-optimal rate in unconstrained
  smooth or composite convex optimization when disregarding logarithmic terms. Numerical
  experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
