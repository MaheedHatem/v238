title: Asynchronous Randomized Trace Estimation
software: https://github.com/gidiko/async-trace
abstract: Randomized trace estimation is a popular technique to approximate the trace
  of an implicitly-defined matrix $A$ by averaging the quadratic form $x’Ax$ across
  several samples of a random vector $x$. This paper focuses on the application of
  randomized trace estimators on asynchronous computing environments where the quadratic
  form $x’Ax$ is computed partially by observing only a random row subset of $A$ for
  each sample of the random vector $x$. Our asynchronous framework treats the number
  of rows, as well as the row subset observed for each sample, as random variables,
  and our theoretical analysis establishes the variance of the randomized estimator
  for Rademacher and Gaussian samples. We also present error analysis and sampling
  complexity bounds for the proposed asynchronous randomized trace estimator. Our
  numerical experiments illustrate that the asynchronous variant can be competitive
  even when a small number of rows is updated per each sample.
