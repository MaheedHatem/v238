title: Tensor-view Topological Graph Neural Network
software: https://github.com/TaoWen0309/TTG-NN
abstract: Graph classification is an important learning task for graph-structured
  data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently gained growing attention in graph
  learning and shown significant improvements on many important graph problems. Despite
  their state-of-the-art performances, existing GNNs only use local information from
  a very limited neighborhood around each node, suffering from loss of multi-modal
  information and overheads of excessive computation. To address these issues, we
  propose a novel Tensor-view Topological Graph Neural Network (TTG-NN), a class of
  simple yet effective topological deep learning built upon persistent homology, graph
  convolution, and tensor operations. This new method incorporates tensor learning
  to simultaneously capture {\it Tensor-view Topological} (TT), as well as Tensor-view
  Graph (TG) structural information on both local and global levels. Computationally,
  to fully exploit graph topology and structure, we propose two flexible TT and TG
  representation learning modules which disentangles feature tensor aggregation and
  transformation, and learns to preserve multi-modal structure with less computation.
  Theoretically, we derive high probability bounds on both the out-of-sample and in-sample
  mean squared approximation errors for our proposed Tensor Transformation Layer (TTL).
  Real data experiments show that the proposed TTG-NN outperforms 20 state-of-the-art
  methods on various graph benchmarks.
