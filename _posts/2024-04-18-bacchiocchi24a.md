title: Autoregressive Bandits
software: https://github.com/gianmarcogenalti/autoregressive-bandits
abstract: Autoregressive processes naturally arise in a large variety of real-world
  scenarios, including stock markets, sales forecasting, weather prediction, advertising,
  and pricing. When facing a sequential decision-making problem in such a context,
  the temporal dependence between consecutive observations should be properly accounted
  for guaranteeing convergence to the optimal policy. In this work, we propose a novel
  online learning setting, namely, Autoregressive Bandits (ARBs), in which the observed
  reward is governed by an autoregressive process of order $k$, whose parameters depend
  on the chosen action. We show that, under mild assumptions on the reward process,
  the optimal policy can be conveniently computed. Then, we devise a new optimistic
  regret minimization algorithm, namely, AutoRegressive Upper Confidence Bound (AR-UCB),
  that suffers sublinear regret of order $\tilde{O} ( \frac{(k+1)^{3/2}\sqrt{nT}}{(1-\Gamma)^2}
  )$, where $T$ is the optimization horizon, $n$ is the number of actions, and $\Gamma
  < 1$ is a stability index of the process. Finally, we empirically validate our algorithm,
  illustrating its advantages w.r.t. bandit baselines and its robustness to misspecification
  of key parameters.
