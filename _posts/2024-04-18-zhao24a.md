title: Positivity-free Policy Learning with Observational Data
software: https://github.com/panzhaooo/positivity-free-policy-learning
abstract: Policy learning utilizing observational data is pivotal across various domains,
  with the objective of learning the optimal treatment assignment policy while adhering
  to specific constraints such as fairness, budget, and simplicity. This study introduces
  a novel positivity-free (stochastic) policy learning framework designed to address
  the challenges posed by the impracticality of the positivity assumption in real-world
  scenarios. This framework leverages incremental propensity score policies to adjust
  propensity score values instead of assigning fixed values to treatments. We characterize
  these incremental propensity score policies and establish identification conditions,
  employing semiparametric efficiency theory to propose efficient estimators capable
  of achieving rapid convergence rates, even when integrated with advanced machine
  learning algorithms. This paper provides a thorough exploration of the theoretical
  guarantees associated with policy learning and validates the proposed frameworkâ€™s
  finite-sample performance through comprehensive numerical experiments, ensuring
  the identification of causal effects from observational data is both robust and
  reliable.
