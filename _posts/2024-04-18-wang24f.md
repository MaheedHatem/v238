title: Invariant Aggregator for Defending against Federated Backdoor Attacks
software: https://github.com/Xiaoyang-Wang/InvariantAggregator
abstract: Federated learning enables training high-utility models across several clients
  without directly sharing their private data. As a downside, the federated setting
  makes the model vulnerable to various adversarial attacks in the presence of malicious
  clients. Despite the theoretical and empirical success in defending against attacks
  that aim to degrade modelsâ€™ utility, defense against backdoor attacks that increase
  model accuracy on backdoor samples exclusively without hurting the utility on other
  samples remains challenging. To this end, we first analyze the failure modes of
  existing defenses over a flat loss landscape, which is common for well-designed
  neural networks such as Resnet (He et al., 2015) but is often overlooked by previous
  works. Then, we propose an invariant aggregator that redirects the aggregated update
  to invariant directions that are generally useful via selectively masking out the
  update elements that favor few and possibly malicious clients. Theoretical results
  suggest that our approach provably mitigates backdoor attacks and remains effective
  over flat loss landscapes. Empirical results on three datasets with different modalities
  and varying numbers of clients further demonstrate that our approach mitigates a
  broad class of backdoor attacks with a negligible cost on the model utility.
