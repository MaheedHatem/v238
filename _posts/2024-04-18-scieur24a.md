title: Adaptive Quasi-Newton and Anderson Acceleration Framework with Explicit Global
  (Accelerated) Convergence Rates
software: https://github.com/windows7lover/QN_With_Guarantees
abstract: Despite the impressive numerical performance of the quasi-Newton and Anderson/nonlinear
  acceleration methods, their global convergence rates have remained elusive for over
  50 years. This study addresses this long-standing issue by introducing a framework
  that derives novel, adaptive quasi-Newton and nonlinear/Anderson acceleration schemes.
  Under mild assumptions, the proposed iterative methods exhibit explicit, non-asymptotic
  convergence rates that blend those of the gradient descent and Cubic Regularized
  Newton’s methods. The proposed approach also includes an accelerated version for
  convex functions. Notably, these rates are achieved adaptively without prior knowledge
  of the function’s parameters. The framework presented in this study is generic,
  and its special cases include algorithms such as Newton’s method with random subspaces,
  finite differences, or lazy Hessian. Numerical experiments demonstrated the efficiency
  of the proposed framework, even compared to the l-BFGS algorithm with Wolfe line-search.
  The code used in the experiments is available on \url{https://github.com/windows7lover/QN_With_Guarantees}.
