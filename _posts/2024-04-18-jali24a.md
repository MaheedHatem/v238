title: Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Routing Jobs in Heterogeneous Queueing
  Systems
abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently routing jobs that arrive into a central
  queue to a system of heterogeneous servers. Unlike homogeneous systems, a threshold
  policy, that routes jobs to the slow server(s) when the queue length exceeds a certain
  threshold, is known to be optimal for the one-fast-one-slow two-server system. But
  an optimal policy for the multi-server system is unknown and non-trivial to find.
  While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been recognized to have great potential for
  learning policies in such cases, our problem has an exponentially large state space
  size, rendering standard RL inefficient. In this work, we propose ACHQ, an efficient
  policy gradient based algorithm with a low dimensional soft threshold policy parameterization
  that leverages the underlying queueing structure. We provide stationary-point convergence
  guarantees for the general case and despite the low-dimensional parameterization
  prove that ACHQ converges to an approximate global optimum for the special case
  of two servers. Simulations demonstrate an improvement in expected response time
  of up to ${\sim}30%$ over the greedy policy that routes to the fastest available
  server.
