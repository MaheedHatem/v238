title: Robust Data Clustering with Outliers via Transformed Tensor Low-Rank Representation
software: https://github.com/twugithub/2024-AISTATS-ORTLRR
abstract: Recently, tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has become a popular tool
  for tensor data recovery and clustering, due to its empirical success and theoretical
  guarantees. However, existing TLRR methods consider Gaussian or gross sparse noise,
  inevitably leading to performance degradation when the tensor data are contaminated
  by outliers or sample-specific corruptions. This paper develops an outlier-robust
  tensor low-rank representation (OR-TLRR) method that provides outlier detection
  and tensor data clustering simultaneously based on the t-SVD framework. For tensor
  observations with arbitrary outlier corruptions, OR-TLRR has provable performance
  guarantee for exactly recovering the row space of clean data and detecting outliers
  under mild conditions. Moreover, an extension of OR-TLRR is proposed to handle the
  case when parts of the data are missing. Finally, extensive experimental results
  on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
