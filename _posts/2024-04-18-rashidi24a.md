title: Cylindrical Thompson Sampling for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization
software: https://github.com/HW-AI-Research/CTS-HDBO
abstract: Many industrial and scientific applications require optimization of one
  or more objectives by tuning dozens or hundreds of input parameters. While Bayesian
  optimization has been a popular approach for the efficient optimization of blackbox
  functions, its performance decreases drastically as the dimensionality of the search
  space increases (i.e., above twenty). Recent advancements in high-dimensional Bayesian
  optimization (HDBO) seek to mitigate this issue through techniques such as adaptive
  local search with trust regions or dimensionality reduction using random embeddings.
  In this paper, we provide a close examination of these advancements and show that
  sampling strategy plays a prominent role and is key to tackling the curse-of-dimensionality.
  We then propose cylindrical Thompson sampling (CTS), a novel strategy that can be
  integrated into single- and multi-objective HDBO algorithms. We demonstrate this
  by integrating CTS as a modular component in state-of-the-art HDBO algorithms. We
  verify the effectiveness of CTS on both synthetic and real-world high-dimensional
  problems, and show that CTS largely enhances existing HDBO methods.
