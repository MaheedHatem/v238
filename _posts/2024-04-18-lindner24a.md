title: Learning Safety Constraints from Demonstrations with Unknown Rewards
software: https://github.com/lasgroup/cocorl
abstract: We propose Convex Constraint Learning for Reinforcement Learning (CoCoRL),
  a novel approach for inferring shared constraints in a Constrained Markov Decision
  Process (CMDP) from a set of safe demonstrations with possibly different reward
  functions. While previous work is limited to demonstrations with known rewards or
  fully known environment dynamics, CoCoRL can learn constraints from demonstrations
  with different unknown rewards without knowledge of the environment dynamics. CoCoRL
  constructs a convex safe set based on demonstrations, which provably guarantees
  safety even for potentially sub-optimal (but safe) demonstrations. For near-optimal
  demonstrations, CoCoRL converges to the true safe set with no policy regret. We
  evaluate CoCoRL in gridworld environments and a driving simulation with multiple
  constraints. CoCoRL learns constraints that lead to safe driving behavior. Importantly,
  we can safely transfer the learned constraints to different tasks and environments.
  In contrast, alternative methods based on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) often
  exhibit poor performance and learn unsafe policies.
