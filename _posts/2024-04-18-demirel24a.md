title: Benchmarking Observational Studies with Experimental Data under Right-Censoring
software: https://github.com/demireal/censored-mmr
abstract: Drawing causal inferences from observational studies (OS) requires unverifiable
  validity assumptions; however, one can falsify those assumptions by benchmarking
  the OS with experimental data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). A major
  limitation of existing procedures is not accounting for censoring, despite the abundance
  of RCTs and OSes that report right-censored time-to-event outcomes. We consider
  two cases where censoring time (1) is independent of time-to-event and (2) depends
  on time-to-event the same way in OS and RCT. For the former, we adopt a censoring-doubly-robust
  signal for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) to facilitate an equivalence
  test of CATEs in OS and RCT, which serves as a proxy for testing if the validity
  assumptions hold. For the latter, we show that the same test can still be used even
  though unbiased CATE estimation may not be possible. We verify the effectiveness
  of our censoring-aware tests via semi-synthetic experiments and analyze RCT and
  OS data from the Womenâ€™s Health Initiative study.
