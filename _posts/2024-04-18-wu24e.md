title: Posterior Uncertainty Quantification in Neural Networks using Data Augmentation
software: https://github.com/apple/ml-MixupMP
abstract: In this paper, we approach the problem of uncertainty quantification in
  deep learning through a predictive framework, which captures uncertainty in model
  parameters by specifying our assumptions about the predictive distribution of unseen
  future data. Under this view, we show that deep ensembling (Lakshminarayanan et
  al., 2017) is a fundamentally mis-specified model class, since it assumes that future
  data are supported on existing observations onlyâ€”a situation rarely encountered
  in practice. To address this limitation, we propose MixupMP, a method that constructs
  a more realistic predictive distribution using popular data augmentation techniques.
  MixupMP operates as a drop-in replacement for deep ensembles, where each ensemble
  member is trained on a random simulation from this predictive distribution. Grounded
  in the recently-proposed framework of Martingale posteriors (Fong et al., 2023),
  MixupMP returns samples from an implicitly defined Bayesian posterior. Our empirical
  analysis showcases that MixupMP achieves superior predictive per- formance and uncertainty
  quantification on various image classification datasets, when compared with existing
  Bayesian and non-Bayesian approaches.
