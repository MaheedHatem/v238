title: Fast Minimization of Expected Logarithmic Loss via Stochastic Dual Averaging
software: https://github.com/chungentsai/pip
abstract: Consider the problem of minimizing an expected logarithmic loss over either
  the probability simplex or the set of quantum density matrices. This problem includes
  tasks such as solving the Poisson inverse problem, computing the maximum-likelihood
  estimate for quantum state tomography, and approximating positive semi-definite
  matrix permanents with the currently tightest approximation ratio. Although the
  optimization problem is convex, standard iteration complexity guarantees for first-order
  methods do not directly apply due to the absence of Lipschitz continuity and smoothness
  in the loss function. In this work, we propose a stochastic first-order algorithm
  named $B$-sample stochastic dual averaging with the logarithmic barrier. For the
  Poisson inverse problem, our algorithm attains an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution
  in $\smash{\tilde{O}}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ time, matching the state of the art, where
  $d$ denotes the dimension. When computing the maximum-likelihood estimate for quantum
  state tomography, our algorithm yields an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution in $\smash{\tilde{O}}(d^3/\varepsilon^2)$
  time. This improves on the time complexities of existing stochastic first-order
  methods by a factor of $d^{\omega-2}$ and those of batch methods by a factor of
  $d^2$, where $\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication exponent. Numerical experiments
  demonstrate that empirically, our algorithm outperforms existing methods with explicit
  complexity guarantees.
