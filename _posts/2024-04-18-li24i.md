title: 'Ethics in Action: Training Reinforcement Learning Agents for Moral Decision-making
  In Text-based Adventure Games'
software: https://github.com/WeichenLi1223/Ethics-in-Action
abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential in solving goal-oriented
  sequential tasks. However, with the increasing capabilities of RL agents, ensuring
  morally responsible agent behavior is becoming a pressing concern. Previous approaches
  have included moral considerations by statically assigning a moral score to each
  action at runtime. However, these methods do not account for the potential moral
  value of future states when evaluating immoral actions. This limits the ability
  to find trade-offs between different aspects of moral behavior and the utility of
  the action. In this paper, we aim to factor in moral scores by adding a constraint
  to the RL objective that is incorporated during training, thereby dynamically adapting
  the policy function. By combining Lagrangian optimization and meta-gradient learning,
  we develop an RL method that is able to find a trade-off between immoral behavior
  and performance in the decision-making process.
