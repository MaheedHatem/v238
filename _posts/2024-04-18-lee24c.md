title: Approximate Bayesian Class-Conditional Models under Continuous Representation
  Shift
software: https://github.com/Tlee43/DeepCCG
abstract: For models consisting of a classifier in some representation space, learning
  online from a non-stationary data stream often necessitates changes in the representation.
  So, the question arises of what is the best way to adapt the classifier to shifts
  in representation. Current methods only slowly change the classifier to representation
  shift, introducing noise into learning as the classifier is misaligned to the representation.
  We propose DeepCCG, an empirical Bayesian approach to solve this problem. DeepCCG
  works by updating the posterior of a class conditional Gaussian classifier such
  that the classifier adapts in one step to representation shift. The use of a class
  conditional Gaussian classifier also enables DeepCCG to use a log conditional marginal
  likelihood loss to update the representation. To perform the update to the classifier
  and representation, DeepCCG maintains a fixed number of examples in memory and so
  a key part of DeepCCG is selecting what examples to store, choosing the subset that
  minimises the KL divergence between the true posterior and the posterior induced
  by the subset. We explore the behaviour of DeepCCG in online continual learning
  (CL), demonstrating that it performs well against a spectrum of online CL methods
  and that it reduces the change in performance due to representation shift.
