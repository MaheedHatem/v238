title: Monitoring machine learning-based risk prediction algorithms in the presence
  of performativity
software: https://github.com/jjfeng/monitoring_ML_performativity
abstract: 'Performance monitoring of machine learning (ML)-based risk prediction models
  in healthcare is complicated by the issue of performativity: when an algorithm predicts
  a patient to be at high risk for an adverse event, clinicians are more likely to
  administer prophylactic treatment and alter the very target that the algorithm aims
  to predict. A simple approach is to ignore performativity and monitor only the untreated
  patients, whose outcomes remain unaltered. In general, ignoring performativity may
  inflate Type I error because (i) untreated patients disproportionally represent
  those with low predicted risk, and (ii) changes in the clinicianâ€™s trust in the
  ML algorithm and the algorithm itself can induce complex dependencies that violate
  standard assumptions. Nevertheless, we show that valid inference is still possible
  when monitoring \textit{conditional} rather than marginal performance measures under
  either the assumption of conditional exchangeability or time-constant selection
  bias. Finally, performativity can vary over time and induce nonstationarity in the
  data, which presents challenges for monitoring. To this end, we introduce a new
  score-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) monitoring procedure with dynamic control limits.
  Through extensive simulation studies, we study applications of the score-based CUSUM
  and how it is affected by various factors, including the efficiency of model updating
  procedures and the level of clinician trust. Finally, we apply the procedure to
  detect calibration decay of a risk model during the COVID-19 pandemic.'
