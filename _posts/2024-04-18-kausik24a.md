title: Offline Policy Evaluation and Optimization Under Confounding
software: https://github.com/hetankevin/off-policy
abstract: Evaluating and optimizing policies in the presence of unobserved confounders
  is a problem of growing interest in offline reinforcement learning. Using conventional
  methods for offline RL in the presence of confounding can not only lead to poor
  decisions and poor policies, but also have disastrous effects in critical applications
  such as healthcare and education. We map out the landscape of offline policy evaluation
  for confounded MDPs, distinguishing assumptions on confounding based on whether
  they are memoryless and on their effect on the data-collection policies. We characterize
  settings where consistent value estimates are provably not achievable, and provide
  algorithms with guarantees to instead estimate lower bounds on the value. When consistent
  estimates are achievable, we provide algorithms for value estimation with sample
  complexity guarantees. We also present new algorithms for offline policy improvement
  and prove local convergence guarantees. Finally, we experimentally evaluate our
  algorithms on both a gridworld environment and a simulated healthcare setting of
  managing sepsis patients. In gridworld, our model-based method provides tighter
  lower bounds than existing methods, while in the sepsis simulator, we demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our method and investigate the importance of a clustering sub-routine.
