title: 'LEDetection: A Simple Framework for Semi-Supervised Few-Shot Object Detection'
software: https://github.com/lexisnexis-risk-open-source/ledetection
abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) is a challenging problem aimed at detecting
  novel concepts from few exemplars. Existing approaches to FSOD all assume abundant
  base labels to adapt to novel objects. This paper studies the new task of semi-supervised
  FSOD by considering a realistic scenario in which both base and novel labels are
  simultaneously scarce. We explore the utility of unlabeled data within our proposed
  label-efficient detection framework and discover its remarkable ability to boost
  semi-supervised FSOD by way of region proposals. Motivated by this finding, we introduce
  SoftER Teacher, a robust detector combining pseudo-labeling with consistency learning
  on region proposals, to harness unlabeled data for improved FSOD without relying
  on abundant labels. Rigorous experiments show that SoftER Teacher surpasses the
  novel performance of a strong supervised detector using only 10% of required base
  labels, without catastrophic forgetting observed in prior approaches. Our work also
  sheds light on a potential relationship between semi-supervised and few-shot detection
  suggesting that a stronger semi-supervised detector leads to a more effective few-shot
  detector.
