title: Taming False Positives in Out-of-Distribution Detection with Human Feedback
software: https://github.com/2454511550Lin/TameFalsePositives-OOD
abstract: Robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is crucial for the safe
  deployment of machine learning models in the open world. Recent works have focused
  on designing scoring functions to quantify OOD uncertainty. Setting appropriate
  thresholds for these scoring functions for OOD detection is challenging as OOD samples
  are often unavailable up front. Typically, thresholds are set to achieve a desired
  true positive rate (TPR), e.g., $95%$ TPR. However, this can lead to very high false
  positive rates (FPR), ranging from 60 to 96%, as observed in the Open-OOD benchmark.
  In safety critical real-life applications, e.g., medical diagnosis, controlling
  the FPR is essential when dealing with various OOD samples dynamically. To address
  these challenges, we propose a mathematically grounded OOD detection framework that
  leverages expert feedback to \emph{safely} update the threshold on the fly. We provide
  theoretical results showing that it is guaranteed to meet the FPR constraint at
  all times while minimizing the use of human feedback. Another key feature of our
  framework is that it can work with any scoring function for OOD uncertainty quantification.
  Empirical evaluation of our system on synthetic and benchmark OOD datasets shows
  that our method can maintain FPR at most $5%$ while maximizing TPR.
