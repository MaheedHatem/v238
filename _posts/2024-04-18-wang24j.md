title: 'On the Effect of Key Factors in Spurious Correlation: A theoretical Perspective'
software: https://github.com/yipei-wang/spurious_feature_mahalanobis
abstract: Spurious correlations arise when irrelevant patterns in input data are mistakenly
  associated with labels, compromising the generalizability of machine learning models.
  While these models may be confident during the training stage, they often falter
  in real-world testing scenarios due to the shift of these misleading correlations.
  Current solutions to this problem typically involve altering the correlations or
  regularizing latent representations. However, while these methods show promise in
  experiments, a rigorous theoretical understanding of their effectiveness and the
  underlying factors of spurious correlations is lacking. In this work, we provide
  a comprehensive theoretical analysis, supported by empirical evidence, to understand
  the intricacies of spurious correlations. Drawing on our proposed theorems, we investigate
  the behaviors of classifiers when confronted with spurious features, and present
  our findings on how various factors influence these correlations and their impact
  on model performances, including the Mahalanobis distance of groups, and training/testing
  spurious correlation ratios. Additionally, by aligning empirical outcomes with our
  theoretical discoveries, we highlight the feasibility of assessing the degree of
  separability of intertwined real-world features. This research paves the way for
  a nuanced comprehension of spurious correlations, laying a solid theoretical groundwork
  that promises to steer future endeavors toward crafting more potent mitigation techniques.
