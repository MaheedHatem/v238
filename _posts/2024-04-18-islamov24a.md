title: 'AsGrad: A Sharp Unified Analysis of Asynchronous-SGD Algorithms'
software: https://github.com/Rustem-Islamov/AsGrad-public
abstract: We analyze asynchronous-type algorithms for distributed SGD in the heterogeneous
  setting, where each worker has its own computation and communication speeds, as
  well as data distribution. In these algorithms, workers compute possibly stale and
  stochastic gradients associated with their local data at some iteration back in
  history and then return those gradients to the server without synchronizing with
  other workers. We present a unified convergence theory for non-convex smooth functions
  in the heterogeneous regime. The proposed analysis provides convergence for pure
  asynchronous SGD and its various modifications. Moreover, our theory explains what
  affects the convergence rate and what can be done to improve the performance of
  asynchronous algorithms. In particular, we introduce a novel asynchronous method
  based on worker shuffling. As a by-product of our analysis, we also demonstrate
  convergence guarantees for gradient-type algorithms such as SGD with random reshuffling
  and shuffle-once mini-batch SGD. The derived rates match the best-known results
  for those algorithms, highlighting the tightness of our approach. Finally, our numerical
  evaluations support theoretical findings and show the good practical performance
  of our method.
