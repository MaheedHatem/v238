title: Gibbs-Based Information Criteria and the Over-Parameterized Regime
software: https://github.com/HaoboChen11/Gibbs-Based-Information-Criteria-and-the-Over-Parameterized-Regime
abstract: Double-descent refers to the unexpected drop in test loss of a learning
  algorithm beyond an interpolating threshold with over-parameterization, which is
  not predicted by information criteria in their classical forms due to the limitations
  in the standard asymptotic approach. We update these analyses using the information
  risk minimization framework and provide Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian
  Information Criterion (BIC) for models learned by the Gibbs algorithm. Notably,
  the penalty terms for the Gibbs-based AIC and BIC correspond to specific information
  measures, i.e., symmetrized KL information and KL divergence. We extend this information-theoretic
  analysis to over-parameterized models by providing two different Gibbs-based BICs
  to compute the marginal likelihood of random feature models in the regime where
  the number of parameters $p$ and the number of samples $n$ tend to infinity, with
  $p/n$ fixed. Our experiments demonstrate that the Gibbs-based BIC can select the
  high-dimensional model and reveal the mismatch between marginal likelihood and population
  risk in the over-parameterized regime, providing new insights to understand double-descent.
