title: On The Temporal Domain of Differential Equation Inspired Graph Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/MosheEliasof/TDE-GNN
abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in modeling
  complex relationships in graph-structured data. A recent innovation in this field
  is the family of Differential Equation-Inspired Graph Neural Networks (DE-GNNs),
  which leverage principles from continuous dynamical systems to model information
  flow on graphs with built-in properties such as feature smoothing or preservation.
  However, existing DE-GNNs rely on first or second-order temporal dependencies. In
  this paper, we propose a neural extension to those pre-defined temporal dependencies.
  We show that our model, called TDE-GNN, can capture a wide range of temporal dynamics
  that go beyond typical first or second-order methods, and provide use cases where
  existing temporal models are challenged. We demonstrate the benefit of learning
  the temporal dependencies using our method rather than using pre-defined temporal
  dynamics on several graph benchmarks.
