title: Escaping Saddle Points in Heterogeneous Federated Learning via Distributed
  SGD with Communication Compression
abstract: We consider the problem of finding second-order stationary points in the
  optimization of heterogeneous federated learning (FL). Previous works in FL mostly
  focus on first-order convergence guarantees, which do not rule out the scenario
  of unstable saddle points. Meanwhile, it is a key bottleneck of FL to achieve communication
  efficiency without compensating the learning accuracy, especially when local data
  are highly heterogeneous across different clients. Given this, we propose a novel
  algorithm PowerEF-SGD that only communicates compressed information via a novel
  error-feedback scheme. To our knowledge, PowerEF-SGD is the first distributed and
  compressed SGD algorithm that provably escapes saddle points in heterogeneous FL
  without any data homogeneity assumptions. In particular, PowerEF-SGD improves to
  second-order stationary points after visiting first-order (possibly saddle) points,
  using additional gradient queries and communication rounds only of almost the same
  order required by first-order convergence, and the convergence rate shows a linear-speedup
  pattern in terms of the number of workers. Our theory improves/recovers previous
  results, while extending to much more tolerant settings on the local data. Numerical
  experiments are provided to complement the theory.
