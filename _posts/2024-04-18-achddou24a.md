title: 'Multitask Online Learning: Listen to the Neighborhood Buzz'
abstract: We study multitask online learning in a setting where agents can only exchange
  information with their neighbors on an arbitrary communication network. We introduce
  MT-CO\textsubscript{2}OL, a decentralized algorithm for this setting whose regret
  depends on the interplay between the task similarities and the network structure.
  Our analysis shows that the regret of MT-CO\textsubscript{2}OL is never worse (up
  to constants) than the bound obtained when agents do not share information. On the
  other hand, our bounds significantly improve when neighboring agents operate on
  similar tasks. In addition, we prove that our algorithm can be made differentially
  private with a negligible impact on the regret. Finally, we provide experimental
  support for our theory.
