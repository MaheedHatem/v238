title: Causal Q-Aggregation for CATE Model Selection
abstract: Accurate estimation of conditional average treatment effects (CATE) is at
  the core of personalized decision making. While there is a plethora of models for
  CATE estimation, model selection is a non-trivial task, due to the fundamental problem
  of causal inference. Recent empirical work provides evidence in favor of proxy loss
  metrics with double robust properties and in favor of model ensembling. However,
  theoretical understanding is lacking. Direct application of prior theoretical works
  leads to suboptimal oracle model selection rates due to the non-convexity of the
  model selection problem. We provide regret rates for the major existing CATE ensembling
  approaches and propose a new CATE model ensembling approach based on $Q$-aggregation
  using the doubly robust loss. Our main result shows that causal $Q$-aggregation
  achieves statistically optimal oracle model selection regret rates of $\log(M)/n$
  (with $M$ models and $n$ samples), with the addition of higher-order estimation
  error terms related to products of errors in the nuisance functions. Crucially,
  our regret rate does not require that any of the candidate CATE models be close
  to the truth. We validate our new method on many semi-synthetic datasets and also
  provide extensions of our work to CATE model selection with instrumental variables
  and unobserved confounding.
