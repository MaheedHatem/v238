title: 'Towards Generalizable and Interpretable Motion Prediction: A Deep Variational
  Bayes Approach'
software: https://github.com/juanwulu/gneva
abstract: Estimating the potential behavior of the surrounding human-driven vehicles
  is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles in a mixed traffic flow. Recent
  state-of-the-art achieved accurate prediction using deep neural networks. However,
  these end-to-end models are usually black boxes with weak interpretability and generalizability.
  This paper proposes the Goal-based Neural Variational Agent (GNeVA), an interpretable
  generative model for motion prediction with robust generalizability to out-of-distribution
  cases. For interpretability, the model achieves target-driven motion prediction
  by estimating the spatial distribution of long-term destinations with a variational
  mixture of Gaussians. We identify a causal structure among maps and agentsâ€™ histories
  and derive a variational posterior to enhance generalizability. Experiments on motion
  prediction datasets validate that the fitted model can be interpretable and generalizable
  and can achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art results.
