title: Information-theoretic Analysis of Bayesian Test Data Sensitivity
software: https://github.com/futoshi-futami/Test_data_uncertainty_AISTSTS2024
abstract: 'Bayesian inference is often used to quantify uncertainty. Several recent
  analyses have rigorously decomposed uncertainty in prediction by Bayesian inference
  into two types: the inherent randomness in the data generation process and the variability
  due to lack of data respectively. Existing studies have analyzed these uncertainties
  from an information-theoretic perspective, assuming the model is well-specified
  and treating the model parameters as latent variables. However, such information-theoretic
  uncertainty analysis fails to account for a widely believed property of uncertainty
  known as sensitivity between test and training data. This means that if the test
  data is similar to the training data in some sense, the uncertainty will be smaller.
  In this study, we study such sensitivity using a new decomposition of uncertainty.
  Our analysis successfully defines such sensitivity using information-theoretic quantities.
  Furthermore, we extend the existing analysis of Bayesian meta-learning and show
  the novel sensitivities among tasks for the first time.'
