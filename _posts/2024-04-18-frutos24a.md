title: Training Implicit Generative Models via an Invariant Statistical Loss
software: https://github.com/josemanuel22/ISL
abstract: Implicit generative models have the capability to learn arbitrary complex
  data distributions. On the downside, training requires telling apart real data from
  artificially-generated ones using adversarial discriminators, leading to unstable
  training and mode-dropping issues. As reported by Zahee et al. (2017), even in the
  one-dimensional (1D) case, training a generative adversarial network (GAN) is challenging
  and often suboptimal. In this work, we develop a discriminator-free method for training
  one-dimensional (1D) generative implicit models and subsequently expand this method
  to accommodate multivariate cases. Our loss function is a discrepancy measure between
  a suitably chosen transformation of the model samples and a uniform distribution;
  hence, it is invariant with respect to the true distribution of the data. We first
  formulate our method for 1D random variables, providing an effective solution for
  approximate reparameterization of arbitrary complex distributions. Then, we consider
  the temporal setting (both univariate and multivariate), in which we model the conditional
  distribution of each sample given the history of the process. We demonstrate through
  numerical simulations that this new method yields promising results, successfully
  learning true distributions in a variety of scenarios and mitigating some of the
  well-known problems that state-of-the-art implicit methods present.
