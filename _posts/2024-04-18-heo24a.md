title: Sample Efficient Learning of Factored Embeddings of Tensor Fields
software: https://github.com/CVC-Lab/ProgressiveSketching
abstract: Data tensors of orders 2 and greater are now routinely being generated.
  These data collections are increasingly huge and growing. Many scientific and medical
  data tensors are tensor fields (e.g., images, videos, geographic data) in which
  the spatial neighborhood contains important information. Directly accessing such
  large data tensor collections for information has become increasingly prohibitive.
  We learn approximate full-rank and compact tensor sketches with decompositive representations
  providing compact space, time and spectral embeddings of tensor fields. All information
  querying and post-processing on the original tensor field can now be achieved more
  efficiently and with customizable accuracy as they are performed on these compact
  factored sketches in latent generative space. We produce optimal rank-r sketchy
  Tucker decomposition of arbitrary order data tensors by building compact factor
  matrices from a sample-efficient sub-sampling of tensor slices. Our sample efficient
  policy is learned via an adaptable stochastic Thompson sampling using Dirichlet
  distributions with conjugate priors.
