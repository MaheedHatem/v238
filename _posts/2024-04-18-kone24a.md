title: 'Bandit Pareto Set Identification: the Fixed Budget Setting'
software: https://github.com/cyrille-kone/ege
abstract: 'We study a multi-objective pure exploration problem in a multi-armed bandit
  model. Each arm is associated to an unknown multi-variate distribution and the goal
  is to identify the distributions whose mean is not uniformly worse than that of
  another distribution: the Pareto optimal set. We propose and analyze the first algorithms
  for the \emph{fixed budget} Pareto Set Identification task. We propose Empirical
  Gap Elimination, a family of algorithms combining a careful estimation of the “hardness
  to classify” each arm in or out of the Pareto set with a generic elimination scheme.
  We prove that two particular instances, EGE-SR and EGE-SH, have a probability of
  error that decays exponentially fast with the budget, with an exponent supported
  by an information theoretic lower-bound. We complement these findings with an empirical
  study using real-world and synthetic datasets, which showcase the good performance
  of our algorithms.'
