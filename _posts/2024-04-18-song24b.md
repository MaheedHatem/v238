title: Fast Dynamic Sampling for Determinantal Point Processes
abstract: n this work, we provide fast dynamic algorithms for repeatedly sampling
  from distributions characterized by Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) and Nonsymmetric
  Determinantal Point Processes (NDPPs). DPPs are a very well-studied class of distributions
  on subsets of items drawn from a ground set of cardinality $n$ characterized by
  a symmetric $n \times n$ kernel matrix $L$ such that the probability of any subset
  is proportional to the determinant of its corresponding principal submatrix. Recent
  work has shown that the kernel symmetry constraint can be relaxed, leading to NDPPs,
  which can better model data in several machine learning applications. Given a low-rank
  kernel matrix ${\cal L}=L+L^\top\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ and its corresponding
  eigendecomposition specified by $\{\lambda_i, u_i \}_{i=1}^d$ where $d\leq n$ is
  the rank, we design a data structure that uses $O(nd)$ space and preprocesses data
  in $O(nd^{\omega-1})$ time where $\omega\approx 2.37$ is the exponent of matrix
  multiplication. The data structure can generate a sample according to DPP distribution
  in time $O(|E|^3\log n+|E|^{\omega-1}d^2)$ or according to NDPP distribution in
  time $O((|E|^3 \log n+ |E|^{\omega-1}d^2)(1+w)^d)$ for $E$ being the sampled indices
  and $w$ is a data-dependent parameter. This improves upon the space and preprocessing
  time over prior works, and achieves a state-of-the-art sampling time when the sampling
  set is relatively dense. At the heart of our data structure is an efficient sampling
  tree that can leverage batch initialization and fast inner product query simultaneously.
