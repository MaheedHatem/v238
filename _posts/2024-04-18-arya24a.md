title: Deep Dependency Networks and Advanced Inference Schemes for Multi-Label Classification
software: https://github.com/Shivvrat/Advanced-Inference-Schemes-for-DDNs
abstract: We present a unified framework called deep dependency networks (DDNs) that
  combines dependency networks and deep learning architectures for multi-label classification,
  with a particular emphasis on image and video data. The primary advantage of dependency
  networks is their ease of training, in contrast to other probabilistic graphical
  models like Markov networks. In particular, when combined with deep learning architectures,
  they provide an intuitive, easy-to-use loss function for multi-label classification.
  A drawback of DDNs compared to Markov networks is their lack of advanced inference
  schemes, necessitating the use of Gibbs sampling. To address this challenge, we
  propose novel inference schemes based on local search and integer linear programming
  for computing the most likely assignment to the labels given observations. We evaluate
  our novel methods on three video datasets (Charades, TACoS, Wetlab) and three image
  datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE), comparing their performance with (a) basic
  neural architectures and (b) neural architectures combined with Markov networks
  equipped with advanced inference and learning techniques. Our results demonstrate
  the superiority of our new DDN methods over the two competing approaches.
