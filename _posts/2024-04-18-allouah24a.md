title: Robust Sparse Voting
software: https://github.com/ysfalh/robust-voting
abstract: 'Many applications, such as content moderation and recommendation, require
  reviewing and scoring a large number of alternatives. Doing so robustly is however
  very challenging. Indeed, voters’ inputs are inevitably sparse: most alternatives
  are only scored by a small fraction of voters. This sparsity amplifies the effects
  of biased voters introducing unfairness, and of malicious voters seeking to hack
  the voting process by reporting dishonest scores. We give a precise definition of
  the problem of robust sparse voting, highlight its underlying technical challenges,
  and present a novel voting mechanism addressing the problem. We prove that, using
  this mechanism, no voter can have more than a small parameterizable effect on each
  alternative’s score; a property we call Lipschitz resilience. We also identify conditions
  of voters comparability under which any unanimous preferences can be recovered,
  even when each voter provides sparse scores, on a scale that is potentially very
  different from any other voter’s score scale. Proving these properties required
  us to introduce, analyze and carefully compose novel aggregation primitives which
  could be of independent interest.'
