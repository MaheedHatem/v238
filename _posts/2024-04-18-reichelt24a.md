title: Beyond Bayesian Model Averaging over Paths in Probabilistic Programs with Stochastic
  Support
software: https://github.com/treigerm/beyond_bma_in_probprog
abstract: 'The posterior in probabilistic programs with stochastic support decomposes
  as a weighted sum of the local posterior distributions associated with each possible
  program path. We show that making predictions with this full posterior implicitly
  performs a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) over paths. This is potentially problematic,
  as BMA weights can be unstable due to model misspecification or inference approximations,
  leading to sub-optimal predictions in turn. To remedy this issue, we propose alternative
  mechanisms for path weighting: one based on stacking and one based on ideas from
  PAC-Bayes. We show how both can be implemented as a cheap post-processing step on
  top of existing inference engines. In our experiments, we find them to be more robust
  and lead to better predictions compared to the default BMA weights.'
