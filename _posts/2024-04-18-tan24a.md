title: Informative Path Planning with Limited Adaptivity
software: https://github.com/rayen-t/Informative-Path-Planning
abstract: We consider the informative path planning (IPP) problem in which a robot
  interacts with an uncertain environment and gathers information by visiting locations.
  The goal is to minimize its expected travel cost to cover a given submodular function.
  Adaptive solutions, where the robot incorporates all available information to select
  the next location to visit, achieve the best objective. However, such a solution
  is resource-intensive as it entails recomputing after every visited location. A
  more practical approach is to design solutions with a small number of adaptive "rounds",
  where the robot recomputes only once at the start of each round. In this paper,
  we design an algorithm for IPP parameterized by the number k of adaptive rounds,
  and prove a smooth tradeoff between k and the solution quality (relative to fully
  adaptive solutions). We validate our theoretical results by experiments on a real
  road network, where we observe that a few rounds of adaptivity suffice to obtain
  solutions of cost almost as good as fully-adaptive ones.
