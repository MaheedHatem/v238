title: Analysis of Using Sigmoid Loss for Contrastive Learning
software: https://github.com/leechungpa/ccem-cl
abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a prominent branch of self-supervised
  learning for several years. Especially, CLIP, which applies contrastive learning
  to large sets of captioned images, has garnered significant attention. Recently,
  SigLIP, a variant of CLIP, has been proposed, which uses the sigmoid loss instead
  of the standard InfoNCE loss. SigLIP achieves the performance comparable to CLIP
  in a more efficient manner by eliminating the need for a global view. However, theoretical
  understanding of using the sigmoid loss in contrastive learning is underexplored.
  In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of using the sigmoid loss in contrastive
  learning, in the perspective of the geometric structure of learned embeddings. First,
  we propose the double-Constant Embedding Model (CCEM), a framework for parameterizing
  various well-known embedding structures by a single variable. Interestingly, the
  proposed CCEM is proven to contain the optimal embedding with respect to the sigmoid
  loss. Second, we mathematically analyze the optimal embedding minimizing the sigmoid
  loss for contrastive learning. The optimal embedding ranges from simplex equiangular-tight-frame
  to antipodal structure, depending on the temperature parameter used in the sigmoid
  loss. Third, our experimental results on synthetic datasets coincide with the theoretical
  results on the optimal embedding structures.
