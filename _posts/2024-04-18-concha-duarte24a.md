title: Online non-parametric likelihood-ratio estimation by Pearson-divergence functional
  minimization
software: https://github.com/AlejandrodelaConcha/OLRE
abstract: Quantifying the difference between two probability density functions, $p$
  and $q$, using available data, is a fundamental problem in Statistics and Machine
  Learning. A usual approach for addressing this problem is the likelihood-ratio estimation
  (LRE) between $p$ and $q$, which -to our best knowledge- has been investigated mainly
  for the offline case. This paper contributes by introducing a new framework for
  online non-parametric LRE (OLRE) for the setting where pairs of iid observations
  $(x_t \sim p, xâ€™_t \sim q)$ are observed over time. The non-parametric nature of
  our approach has the advantage of being agnostic to the forms of $p$ and $q$. Moreover,
  we capitalize on the recent advances in Kernel Methods and functional minimization
  to develop an estimator that can be efficiently updated at every iteration. We provide
  theoretical guarantees for the performance of the OLRE method along with empirical
  validation in synthetic experiments.
