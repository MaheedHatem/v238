title: Delegating Data Collection in Decentralized Machine Learning
abstract: 'Motivated by the emergence of decentralized machine learning (ML) ecosystems,
  we study the delegation of data collection. Taking the field of contract theory
  as our starting point, we design optimal and near-optimal contracts that deal with
  two fundamental information asymmetries that arise in decentralized ML: uncertainty
  in the assessment of model quality and uncertainty regarding the optimal performance
  of any model. We show that a principal can cope with such asymmetry via simple linear
  contracts that achieve $1-1/\epsilon$ fraction of the optimal utility. To address
  the lack of a priori knowledge regarding the optimal performance, we give a convex
  program that can adaptively and efficiently compute the optimal contract. We also
  analyze the optimal utility and linear contracts for the more complex setting of
  multiple interactions.'
