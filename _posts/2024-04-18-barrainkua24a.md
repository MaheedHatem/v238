abstract: Recent studies highlight the effectiveness of Bayesian methods in assessing
  algorithm performance, particularly in fairness and bias evaluation. We present
  Uncertainty Matters, a multi-objective uncertainty-aware algorithmic comparison
  framework. In fairness focused scenarios, it models sensitive group confusion matrices
  using Bayesian updates and facilitates joint comparison of performance (e.g., accuracy)
  and fairness metrics (e.g., true positive rate parity). Our approach works seamlessly
  with common evaluation methods like K-fold cross-validation, effectively addressing
  dependencies among the K posterior metric distributions. The integration of correlated
  information is carried out through a procedure tailored to the classifierâ€™s complexity.
  Experiments demonstrate that the insights derived from algorithmic comparisons employing
  the Uncertainty Matters approach are more informative, reliable, and less influenced
  by particular data partitions. Code for the paper is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/abarrainkua/UncertaintyMatters}.
