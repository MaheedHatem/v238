title: Model-based Policy Optimization under Approximate Bayesian Inference
software: https://github.com/alecwangcq/approximate-inference-posterior-sampling
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning algorithmsÂ (MBRL) present an exceptional
  potential to enhance sample efficiency within the realm of online reinforcement
  learning (RL). Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of prevalent MBRL algorithms
  fail to adequately address the dichotomy of exploration and exploitation. Posterior
  sampling reinforcement learning (PSRL) emerges as an innovative strategy adept at
  balancing exploration and exploitation, albeit its theoretical assurances are contingent
  upon exact inference. In this paper, we show that adopting the same methodology
  as in exact PSRL can be suboptimal under approximate inference. Motivated by the
  analysis, we propose an improved factorization for the posterior distribution of
  polices by removing the conditional independence between the policy and data given
  the model. By adopting such a posterior factorization, we further propose a general
  algorithmic framework for PSRL under approximate inference and a practical instantiation
  of it. Empirically, our algorithm can surpass baseline methods by a significant
  margin on both dense rewards and sparse rewards tasks from the Deepmind control
  suite, OpenAI Gym and Metaworld benchmarks.
