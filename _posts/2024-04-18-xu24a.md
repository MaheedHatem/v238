title: Online multiple testing with e-values
software: https://github.com/neilzxu/evalue-omt
abstract: A scientist tests a continuous stream of hypotheses over time in the course
  of her investigation — she does not test a predetermined, fixed number of hypotheses.
  The scientist wishes to make as many discoveries as possible while ensuring the
  number of false discoveries is controlled — a well recognized way for accomplishing
  this is to control the false discovery rate (FDR). Prior methods for FDR control
  in the online setting have focused on formulating algorithms when specific dependency
  structures are assumed to exist between the test statistics of each hypothesis.
  However, in practice, these dependencies often cannot be known beforehand or tested
  after the fact. Our algorithm, e-LOND, provides FDR control under arbitrary, possibly
  unknown, dependence. We show that our method is more powerful than existing approaches
  to this problem through simulations. We also formulate extensions of this algorithm
  to utilize randomization for increased power and for constructing confidence intervals
  in online selective inference.
