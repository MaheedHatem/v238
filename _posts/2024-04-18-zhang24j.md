title: Fast and Accurate Estimation of Low-Rank Matrices from Noisy Measurements via
  Preconditioned Non-Convex Gradient Descent
abstract: Non-convex gradient descent is a common approach for estimating a low-rank
  $n\times n$ ground truth matrix from noisy measurements, because it has per-iteration
  costs as low as $O(n)$ time, and is in theory capable of converging to a minimax
  optimal estimate. However, the practitioner is often constrained to just tens to
  hundreds of iterations, and the slow and/or inconsistent convergence of non-convex
  gradient descent can prevent a high-quality estimate from being obtained. Recently,
  the technique of \emph{preconditioning} was shown to be highly effective at accelerating
  the local convergence of non-convex gradient descent when the measurements are noiseless.
  In this paper, we describe how preconditioning should be done for noisy measurements
  to accelerate local convergence to minimax optimality. For the symmetric matrix
  sensing problem, our proposed preconditioned method is guaranteed to locally converge
  to minimax error at a linear rate that is immune to ill-conditioning and/or over-parameterization.
  Using our proposed preconditioned method, we perform a 60 megapixel medical image
  denoising task, and observe significantly reduced noise levels compared to previous
  approaches.
