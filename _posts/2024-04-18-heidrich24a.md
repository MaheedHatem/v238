title: A 4-Approximation Algorithm for Min Max Correlation Clustering
software: https://github.com/JannikIrmai/min-max-correlation-clustering
abstract: We introduce a lower bounding technique for the min max correlation clustering
  problem and, based on this technique, a combinatorial 4-approximation algorithm
  for complete graphs. This improves upon the previous best known approximation guarantees
  of 5, using a linear program formulation (Kalhan et al., 2019), and 40, for a combinatorial
  algorithm (Davies et al., 2023). We extend this algorithm by a greedy joining heuristic
  and show empirically that it improves the state of the art in solution quality and
  runtime on several benchmark datasets.
