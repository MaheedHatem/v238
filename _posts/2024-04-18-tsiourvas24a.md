title: Manifold-Aligned Counterfactual Explanations for Neural Networks
abstract: We study the problem of finding optimal manifold-aligned counterfactual
  explanations for neural networks. Existing approaches that involve solving a complex
  mixed-integer optimization (MIP) problem frequently suffer from scalability issues,
  limiting their practical usefulness. Furthermore, the solutions are not guaranteed
  to follow the data manifold, resulting in unrealistic counterfactual explanations.
  To address these challenges, we first present a MIP formulation where we explicitly
  enforce manifold alignment by reformulating the highly nonlinear Local Outlier Factor
  (LOF) metric as mixed-integer constraints. To address the computational challenge,
  we leverage the geometry of a trained neural network and propose an efficient decomposition
  scheme that reduces the initial large, hard-to-solve optimization problem into a
  series of significantly smaller, easier-to-solve problems by constraining the search
  space to “live” polytopes, i.e., regions that contain at least one actual data point.
  Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in producing
  both optimal and realistic counterfactual explanations, and computational traceability.
