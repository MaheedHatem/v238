title: Preventing Arbitrarily High Confidence on Far-Away Data in Point-Estimated
  Discriminative Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/serenahacker/PreLoad
abstract: Discriminatively trained, deterministic neural networks are the de facto
  choice for classification problems. However, even though they achieve state-of-the-art
  results on in-domain test sets, they tend to be overconfident on out-of-distribution
  (OOD) data. For instance, ReLU networks—a popular class of neural network architectures—have
  been shown to almost always yield high confidence predictions when the test data
  are far away from the training set, even when they are trained with OOD data. We
  overcome this problem by adding a term to the output of the neural network that
  corresponds to the logit of an extra class, that we design to dominate the logits
  of the original classes as we move away from the training data. This technique provably
  prevents arbitrarily high confidence on far-away test data while maintaining a simple
  discriminative point-estimate training. Evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates
  strong performance against competitive baselines on both far-away and realistic
  OOD data.
