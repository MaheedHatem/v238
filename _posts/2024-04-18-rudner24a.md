title: 'Mind the GAP: Improving Robustness to Subpopulation Shifts with Group-Aware
  Priors'
software: https://github.com/timrudner/group-aware-priors
abstract: Machine learning models often perform poorly under subpopulation shifts
  in the data distribution. Developing methods that allow machine learning models
  to better generalize to such shifts is crucial for safe deployment in real-world
  settings. In this paper, we develop a family of group-aware prior (GAP) distributions
  over neural network parameters that explicitly favor models that generalize well
  under subpopulation shifts. We design a simple group-aware prior that only requires
  access to a small set of data with group information and demonstrate that training
  with this prior yields state-of-the-art performanceâ€”even when only retraining the
  final layer of a previously trained non-robust model. Group aware-priors are conceptually
  simple, complementary to existing approaches, such as attribute pseudo labeling
  and data reweighting, and open up promising new avenues for harnessing Bayesian
  inference to enable robustness to subpopulation shifts.
