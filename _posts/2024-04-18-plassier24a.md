title: Efficient Conformal Prediction under Data Heterogeneity
abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) stands out as a robust framework for uncertainty
  quantification, which is crucial for ensuring the reliability of predictions. However,
  common CP methods heavily rely on the data exchangeability, a condition often violated
  in practice. Existing approaches for tackling non-exchangeability lead to methods
  that are not computable beyond the simplest examples. In this work, we introduce
  a new efficient approach to CP that produces provably valid confidence sets for
  fairly general non-exchangeable data distributions. We illustrate the general theory
  with applications to the challenging setting of federated learning under data heterogeneity
  between agents. Our method allows constructing provably valid personalized prediction
  sets for agents in a fully federated way. The effectiveness of the proposed method
  is demonstrated in a series of experiments on real-world datasets.
