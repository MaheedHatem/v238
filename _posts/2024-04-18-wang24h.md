title: 'Don’t Be Pessimistic Too Early: Look K Steps Ahead!'
software: https://github.com/alecwangcq/lookahead-mdp
abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) considers to train highly rewarding
  policies exclusively from existing data, showing great real-world impacts. Pessimism,
  \emph{i.e.}, avoiding uncertain states or actions during decision making, has long
  been the main theme for offline RL. However, existing works often lead to overly
  conservative policies with rather sub-optimal performance. To tackle this challenge,
  we introduce the notion of \emph{lookahead pessimism} within the model-based offline
  RL paradigm. Intuitively, while the classical pessimism principle asks to terminate
  whenever the RL agent reaches an uncertain region, our method allows the agent to
  use a lookahead set carefully crafted from the learned model, and to make a move
  by properties of the lookahead set. Remarkably, we show that this enables learning
  a less conservative policy with a better performance guarantee. We refer to our
  method as Lookahead Pessimistic MDP (LP-MDP). Theoretically, we provide a rigorous
  analysis on the performance lower bound, which monotonically improves with the lookahead
  steps. Empirically, with the easy-to-implement design of LP-MDP, we demonstrate
  a solid performance improvement over baseline methods on widely used offline RL
  benchmarks.
