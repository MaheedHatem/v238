title: On the Expected Size of Conformal Prediction Sets
software: https://github.com/Guneet-Dhillon/expected-conformal-prediction-set-size
abstract: While conformal predictors reap the benefits of rigorous statistical guarantees
  on their error frequency, the size of their corresponding prediction sets is critical
  to their practical utility. Unfortunately, there is currently a lack of finite-sample
  analysis and guarantees for their prediction set sizes. To address this shortfall,
  we theoretically quantify the expected size of the prediction sets under the split
  conformal prediction framework. As this precise formulation cannot usually be calculated
  directly, we further derive point estimates and high-probability interval bounds
  that can be empirically computed, providing a practical method for characterizing
  the expected set size. We corroborate the efficacy of our results with experiments
  on real-world datasets for both regression and classification problems.
