title: 'TransFusion: Covariate-Shift Robust Transfer Learning for High-Dimensional
  Regression'
abstract: The main challenge that sets transfer learning apart from traditional supervised
  learning is the distribution shift, reflected as the shift between the source and
  target models and that between the marginal covariate distributions. In this work,
  we tackle model shifts in the presence of covariate shifts in the high-dimensional
  regression setting. Specifically, we propose a two-step method with a novel fused
  regularizer that effectively leverages samples from source tasks to improve the
  learning performance on a target task with limited samples. Nonasymptotic bound
  is provided for the estimation error of the target model, showing the robustness
  of the proposed method to covariate shifts. We further establish conditions under
  which the estimator is minimax-optimal. Additionally, we extend the method to a
  distributed setting, allowing for a pretraining-finetuning strategy, requiring just
  one round of communication while retaining the estimation rate of the centralized
  version. Numerical tests validate our theory, highlighting the methodâ€™s robustness
  to covariate shifts.
