title: SDEs for Minimax Optimization
software: https://github.com/eneamc/MinimaxSDEs
abstract: Minimax optimization problems have attracted a lot of attention over the
  past few years, with applications ranging from economics to machine learning. While
  advanced optimization methods exist for such problems, characterizing their dynamics
  in stochastic scenarios remains notably challenging. In this paper, we pioneer the
  use of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) to analyze and compare Minimax optimizers.
  Our SDE models for Stochastic Gradient Descent-Ascent, Stochastic Extragradient,
  and Stochastic Hamiltonian Gradient Descent are provable approximations of their
  algorithmic counterparts, clearly showcasing the interplay between hyperparameters,
  implicit regularization, and implicit curvature-induced noise. This perspective
  also allows for a unified and simplified analysis strategy based on the principles
  of It√¥ calculus. Finally, our approach facilitates the derivation of convergence
  conditions and closed-form solutions for the dynamics in simplified settings, unveiling
  further insights into the behavior of different optimizers.
