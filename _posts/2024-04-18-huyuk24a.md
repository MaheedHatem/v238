title: Adaptive Experiment Design with Synthetic Controls
software: https://github.com/alihanhyk/syntax
abstract: Clinical trials are typically run in order to understand the effects of
  a new treatment on a given population of patients. However, patients in large populations
  rarely respond the same way to the same treatment. This heterogeneity in patient
  responses necessitates trials that investigate effects on multiple subpopulations—especially
  when a treatment has marginal or no benefit for the overall population but might
  have significant benefit for a particular subpopulation. Motivated by this need,
  we propose Syntax, an exploratory trial design that identifies subpopulations with
  positive treatment effect among many subpopulations. Syntax is sample efficient
  as it (i) recruits and allocates patients adaptively and (ii) estimates treatment
  effects by forming synthetic controls for each subpopulation that combines control
  samples from other subpopulations. We validate the performance of Syntax and provide
  insights into when it might have an advantage over conventional trial designs through
  experiments.
