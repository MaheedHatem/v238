title: Tackling the XAI Disagreement Problem with Regional Explanations
software: https://github.com/gablabc/UXAI_ANOVA
abstract: The XAI Disagreement Problem concerns the fact that various explainability
  methods yield different local/global insights on model behavior. Thus, given the
  lack of ground truth in explainability, practitioners are left wondering “Which
  explanation should I believe?”. In this work, we approach the Disagreement Problem
  from the point of view of Functional Decomposition (FD). First, we demonstrate that
  many XAI techniques disagree because they handle feature interactions differently.
  Secondly, we reduce interactions locally by fitting a so-called FD-Tree, which partitions
  the input space into regions where the model is approximately additive. Thus instead
  of providing global explanations aggregated over the whole dataset, we advocate
  reporting the FD-Tree structure as well as the regional explanations extracted from
  its leaves. The beneficial effects of FD-Trees on the Disagreement Problem are demonstrated
  on toy and real datasets.
