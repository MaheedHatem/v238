title: 'CAD-DA: Controllable Anomaly Detection after Domain Adaptation by Statistical
  Inference'
software: https://github.com/vonguyenleduy/CAD-DA
abstract: We propose a novel statistical method for testing the results of anomaly
  detection (AD) under domain adaptation (DA), which we call CAD-DAâ€”controllable AD
  under DA. The distinct advantage of the CAD-DA lies in its ability to control the
  probability of misidentifying anomalies under a pre-specified level $\alpha$ (e.g.,
  0.05). The challenge within this DA setting is the necessity to account for the
  influence of DA to ensure the validity of the inference results. We overcome the
  challenge by leveraging the concept of Selective Inference to handle the impact
  of DA. To our knowledge, this is the first work capable of conducting a valid statistical
  inference within the context of DA. We evaluate the performance of the CAD-DA method
  on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
