title: 'Central Limit Theorem for Two-Timescale Stochastic Approximation with Markovian
  Noise: Theory and Applications'
abstract: Two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) is among the most general
  frameworks for iterative stochastic algorithms. This includes well-known stochastic
  optimization methods such as SGD variants and those designed for bilevel or minimax
  problems, as well as reinforcement learning like the family of gradient-based temporal
  difference (GTD) algorithms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth asymptotic analysis
  of TTSA under controlled Markovian noise via central limit theorem (CLT), uncovering
  the coupled dynamics of TTSA influenced by the underlying Markov chain, which has
  not been addressed by previous CLT results of TTSA only with Martingale difference
  noise. Building upon our CLT, we expand its application horizon of efficient sampling
  strategies from vanilla SGD to a wider TTSA context in distributed learning, thus
  broadening the scope of Hu et al. 2020. In addition, we leverage our CLT result
  to deduce the statistical properties of GTD algorithms with nonlinear function approximation
  using Markovian samples and show their identical asymptotic performance, a perspective
  not evident from current finite-time bounds.
