title: An Analytic Solution to Covariance Propagation in Neural Networks
software: https://github.com/omwright/cov-prop-nn/
abstract: Uncertainty quantification of neural networks is critical to measuring the
  reliability and robustness of deep learning systems. However, this often involves
  costly or inaccurate sampling methods and approximations. This paper presents a
  sample-free moment propagation technique that propagates mean vectors and covariance
  matrices across a network to accurately characterize the input-output distributions
  of neural networks. A key enabler of our technique is an analytic solution for the
  covariance of random variables passed through nonlinear activation functions, such
  as Heaviside, ReLU, and GELU. The wide applicability and merits of the proposed
  technique are shown in experiments analyzing the input-output distributions of trained
  neural networks and training Bayesian neural networks.
