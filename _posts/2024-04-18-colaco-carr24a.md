title: Conditions on Preference Relations that Guarantee the Existence of Optimal
  Policies
abstract: Learning from Preferential Feedback (LfPF) plays an essential role in training
  Large Language Models, as well as certain types of interactive learning agents.
  However, a substantial gap exists between the theory and application of LfPF algorithms.
  Current results guaranteeing the existence of optimal policies in LfPF problems
  assume that both the preferences and transition dynamics are determined by a Markov
  Decision Process. We introduce the Direct Preference Process, a new framework for
  analyzing LfPF problems in partially-observable, non-Markovian environments. Within
  this framework, we establish conditions that guarantee the existence of optimal
  policies by considering the ordinal structure of the preferences. We show that a
  decision-making problem can have optimal policies – that are characterized by recursive
  optimality equations – even when no reward function can express the learning goal.
  These findings underline the need to explore preference-based learning strategies
  which do not assume that preferences are generated by reward.
