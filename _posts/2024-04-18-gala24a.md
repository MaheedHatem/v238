title: Probabilistic Integral Circuits
software: https://github.com/gengala/pic
abstract: Continuous latent variables (LVs) are a key ingredient of many generative
  models, as they allow modelling expressive mixtures with an uncountable number of
  components. In contrast, probabilistic circuits (PCs) are hierarchical discrete
  mixtures represented as computational graphs composed of input, sum and product
  units. Unlike continuous LV models, PCs provide tractable inference but are limited
  to discrete LVs with categorical (i.e. unordered) states. We bridge these model
  classes by introducing probabilistic integral circuits (PICs), a new language of
  computational graphs that extends PCs with integral units representing continuous
  LVs. In the first place, PICs are symbolic computational graphs and are fully tractable
  in simple cases where analytical integration is possible. In practice, we parameterise
  PICs with light-weight neural nets delivering an intractable hierarchical continuous
  mixture that can be approximated arbitrarily well with large PCs using numerical
  quadrature. On several distribution estimation benchmarks, we show that such PIC-approximating
  PCs systematically outperform PCs commonly learned via expectation-maximization
  or SGD.
