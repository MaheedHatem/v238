title: 'DeepFDR: A Deep Learning-based False Discovery Rate Control Method for Neuroimaging
  Data'
software: https://github.com/kimtae55/DeepFDR
abstract: Voxel-based multiple testing is widely used in neuroimaging data analysis.
  Traditional false discovery rate (FDR) control methods often ignore the spatial
  dependence among the voxel-based tests and thus suffer from substantial loss of
  testing power. While recent spatial FDR control methods have emerged, their validity
  and optimality remain questionable when handling the complex spatial dependencies
  of the brain. Concurrently, deep learning methods have revolutionized image segmentation,
  a task closely related to voxel-based multiple testing. In this paper, we propose
  DeepFDR, a novel spatial FDR control method that leverages unsupervised deep learning-based
  image segmentation to address the voxel-based multiple testing problem. Numerical
  studies, including comprehensive simulations and Alzheimer’s disease FDG-PET image
  analysis, demonstrate DeepFDR’s superiority over existing methods. DeepFDR not only
  excels in FDR control and effectively diminishes the false nondiscovery rate, but
  also boasts exceptional computational efficiency highly suited for tackling large-scale
  neuroimaging data.
