title: Inconsistency of Cross-Validation for Structure Learning in Gaussian Graphical
  Models
software: https://github.com/zhao-lyu/GGM
abstract: Despite numerous years of research into the merits and trade-offs of various
  model selection criteria, obtaining robust results that elucidate the behavior of
  cross-validation remains a challenging endeavor. In this paper, we highlight the
  inherent limitations of cross-validation when employed to discern the structure
  of a Gaussian graphical model. We provide finite-sample bounds on the probability
  that the Lasso estimator for the neighborhood of a node within a Gaussian graphical
  model, optimized using a prediction oracle, misidentifies the neighborhood. Our
  results pertain to both undirected and directed acyclic graphs, encompassing general,
  sparse covariance structures. To support our theoretical findings, we conduct an
  empirical investigation of this inconsistency by contrasting our outcomes with other
  commonly used information criteria through an extensive simulation study. Given
  that many algorithms designed to learn the structure of graphical models require
  hyperparameter selection, the precise calibration of this hyperparameter is paramount
  for accurately estimating the inherent structure. Consequently, our observations
  shed light on this widely recognized practical challenge.
