title: Differentially Private Conditional Independence Testing
software: https://github.com/iden-kalemaj/PrivateCITesting/
abstract: 'Conditional independence (CI) tests are widely used in statistical data
  analysis, e.g., they are the building block of many algorithms for causal graph
  discovery. The goal of a CI test is to accept or reject the null hypothesis that
  $X \perp \!\!\! \perp Y \mid Z$, where $X \in \mathbb{R}, Y \in \mathbb{R}, Z \in
  \mathbb{R}^d$. In this work, we investigate conditional independence testing under
  the constraint of differential privacy. We design two private CI testing procedures:
  one based on the generalized covariance measure of Shah and Peters (2020) and another
  based on the conditional randomization test of Cand{Ã¨}s et al. (2016) (under the
  model-X assumption). We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of our
  tests and validate them empirically. These are the first private CI tests with rigorous
  theoretical guarantees that work for the general case when $Z$ is continuous.'
