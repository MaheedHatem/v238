title: Policy Learning for Localized Interventions from Observational Data
software: https://github.com/marmarelis/nudge-policies
abstract: A largely unaddressed problem in causal inference is that of learning reliable
  policies in continuous, high-dimensional treatment variables from observational
  data. Especially in the presence of strong confounding, it can be infeasible to
  learn the entire heterogeneous response surface from treatment to outcome. It is
  also not particularly useful, when there are practical constraints on the size of
  the interventions altering the observational treatments. Since it tends to be easier
  to learn the outcome for treatments near existing observations, we propose a new
  framework for evaluating and optimizing the effect of small, tailored, and localized
  interventions that nudge the observed treatment assignments. Our doubly robust effect
  estimator plugs into a policy learner that stays within the interventional scope
  by optimal transport. Consequently, the error of the total policy effect is restricted
  to prediction errors nearby the observational distribution, rather than the whole
  response surface.
