title: 'From Coupled Oscillators to Graph Neural Networks: Reducing Over-smoothing
  via a Kuramoto Model-based Approach'
abstract: We propose the Kuramoto Graph Neural Network (KuramotoGNN), a novel class
  of continuous-depth graph neural networks (GNNs) that employs the Kuramoto model
  to mitigate the over-smoothing phenomenon, in which node features in GNNs become
  indistinguishable as the number of layers increases. The Kuramoto model captures
  the synchronization behavior of non-linear coupled oscillators. Under the view of
  coupled oscillators, we first show the connection between Kuramoto model and basic
  GNN and then over-smoothing phenomenon in GNNs can be interpreted as phase synchronization
  in Kuramoto model. The KuramotoGNN replaces this phase synchronization with frequency
  synchronization to prevent the node features from converging into each other while
  allowing the system to still reach a stable synchronized state. We experimentally
  verify the advantages of the KuramotoGNN over the baseline GNNs and existing methods
  in reducing over-smoothing on various graph deep learning benchmark tasks.
