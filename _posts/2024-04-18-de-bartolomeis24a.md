title: 'Hidden yet quantifiable: A lower bound for confounding strength using randomized
  trials'
software: https://github.com/jaabmar/confounder-lower-bound
abstract: In the era of fast-paced precision medicine, observational studies play
  a major role in properly evaluating new treatments in clinical practice. Yet, unobserved
  confounding can significantly compromise causal conclusions drawn from non-randomized
  data. We propose a novel strategy that leverages randomized trials to quantify unobserved
  confounding. First, we design a statistical test to detect unobserved confounding
  above a certain strength. Then, we use the test to estimate an asymptotically valid
  lower bound on the unobserved confounding strength. We evaluate the power and validity
  of our statistical test on several synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets. Further,
  we show how our lower bound can correctly identify the absence and presence of unobserved
  confounding in a real-world example.
