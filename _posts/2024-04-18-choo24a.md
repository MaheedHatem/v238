title: Causal Discovery under Off-Target Interventions
software: https://github.com/cxjdavin/causal-discovery-under-off-target-interventions
abstract: 'Causal graph discovery is a significant problem with applications across
  various disciplines. However, with observational data alone, the underlying causal
  graph can only be recovered up to its Markov equivalence class, and further assumptions
  or interventions are necessary to narrow down the true graph. This work addresses
  the causal discovery problem under the setting of stochastic interventions with
  the natural goal of minimizing the number of interventions performed. We propose
  the following stochastic intervention model which subsumes existing adaptive noiseless
  interventions in the literature while capturing scenarios such as fat-hand interventions
  and CRISPR gene knockouts: any intervention attempt results in an actual intervention
  on a random subset of vertices, drawn from a \emph{distribution dependent on attempted
  action}. Under this model, we study the two fundamental problems in causal discovery
  of verification and search and provide approximation algorithms with polylogarithmic
  competitive ratios and provide some preliminary experimental results.'
