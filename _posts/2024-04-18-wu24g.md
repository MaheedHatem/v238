title: Unsupervised Change Point Detection in Multivariate Time Series
abstract: We consider the challenging problem of unsupervised change point detection
  in multivariate time series when the number of change points is unknown. Our method
  eliminates the userâ€™s need for careful parameter tuning, enhancing its practicality
  and usability. Our approach identifies time series segments with similar empirically
  estimated distributions, coupled with a novel greedy algorithm guided by the minimum
  description length principle. We provide theoretical guarantees and, through experiments
  on synthetic and real-world data, provide empirical evidence for its improved performance
  in identifying meaningful change points in practical settings.
