title: Approximate Control for Continuous-Time POMDPs
software: https://github.com/yannickeich/ApproxPOMDPs
abstract: This work proposes a decision-making framework for partially observable
  systems in continuous time with discrete state and action spaces. As optimal decision-making
  becomes intractable for large state spaces we employ approximation methods for the
  filtering and the control problem that scale well with an increasing number of states.
  Specifically, we approximate the high-dimensional filtering distribution by projecting
  it onto a parametric family of distributions, and integrate it into a control heuristic
  based on the fully observable system to obtain a scalable policy. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our approach on several partially observed systems, including
  queueing systems and chemical reaction networks.
