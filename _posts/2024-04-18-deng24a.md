title: Sample Complexity Characterization for Linear Contextual MDPs
abstract: 'Contextual Markov decision processes (CMDPs) describe a class of reinforcement
  learning problems in which the transition kernels and reward functions can change
  over time with different MDPs indexed by a context variable. While CMDPs serve as
  an important framework to model many real-world applications with time-varying environments,
  they are largely unexplored from theoretical perspective. In this paper, we study
  CMDPs under two linear function approximation models: Model I with context-varying
  representations and common linear weights for all contexts; and Model II with common
  representations for all contexts and context-varying linear weights. For both models,
  we propose novel model-based algorithms and show that they enjoy guaranteed $\epsilon$-suboptimality
  gap with desired polynomial sample complexity. In particular, instantiating our
  result for the first model to the tabular CMDP improves the existing result by removing
  the reachability assumption. Our result for the second model is the first-known
  result for such a type of function approximation models. Comparison between our
  results for the two models further indicates that having context-varying features
  leads to much better sample efficiency than having common representations for all
  contexts under linear CMDPs.'
