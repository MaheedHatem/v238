title: Reparameterized Variational Rejection Sampling
software: https://github.com/martinjankowiak/rvrs_example_code
abstract: Traditional approaches to variational inference rely on parametric families
  of variational distributions, with the choice of family playing a critical role
  in determining the accuracy of the resulting posterior approximation. Simple mean-field
  families often lead to poor approximations, while rich families of distributions
  like normalizing flows can be difficult to optimize and usually do not incorporate
  the known structure of the target distribution due to their black-box nature. To
  expand the space of flexible variational families, we revisit Variational Rejection
  Sampling (VRS) [Grover et al., 2018], which combines a parametric proposal distribution
  with rejection sampling to define a rich non-parametric family of distributions
  that explicitly utilizes the known target distribution. By introducing a low-variance
  reparameterized gradient estimator for the parameters of the proposal distribution,
  we make VRS an attractive inference strategy for models with continuous latent variables.
  We argue theoretically and demonstrate empirically that the resulting method–Reparameterized
  Variational Rejection Sampling (RVRS)–offers an attractive trade-off between computational
  cost and inference fidelity. In experiments we show that our method performs well
  in practice and that it is well suited for black-box inference, especially for models
  with local latent variables.
