title: Fixed-kinetic Neural Hamiltonian Flows for enhanced interpretability and reduced
  complexity

abstract: Normalizing Flows (NF) are Generative models which transform a simple prior
  distribution into the desired target. They however require the design of an invertible
  mapping whose Jacobian determinant has to be computable. Recently introduced, Neural
  Hamiltonian Flows (NHF) are Hamiltonian dynamics-based flows, which are continuous,
  volume-preserving and invertible and thus make for natural candidates for robust
  NF architectures. In particular, their similarity to classical Mechanics could lead
  to easier interpretability of the learned mapping. In this paper, we show that the
  current NHF architecture may still pose a challenge to interpretability. Inspired
  by Physics, we introduce a fixed-kinetic energy version of the model. This approach
  improves interpretability and robustness while requiring fewer parameters than the
  original model. We illustrate that on a 2D Gaussian mixture and on the MNIST and
  Fashion-MNIST datasets. Finally, we show how to adapt NHF to the context of Bayesian
  inference and illustrate the method on an example from cosmology.
