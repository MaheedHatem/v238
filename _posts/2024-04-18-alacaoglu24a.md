title: Complexity of Single Loop Algorithms for Nonlinear Programming with Stochastic
  Objective and Constraints
abstract: 'We analyze the sample complexity of single-loop quadratic penalty and augmented
  Lagrangian algorithms for solving nonconvex optimization problems with functional
  equality constraints. We consider three cases, in all of which the objective is
  stochastic, that is, an expectation over an unknown distribution that is accessed
  by sampling. The nature of the equality constraints differs among the three cases:
  deterministic and linear in the first case, deterministic and nonlinear in the second
  case, and stochastic and nonlinear in the third case. Variance reduction techniques
  are used to improve the complexity. To find a point that satisfies $\varepsilon$-approximate
  first-order conditions, we require $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ complexity
  in the first case, $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-4})$ in the second case, and $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-5})$
  in the third case. For the first and third cases, they are the first algorithms
  of “single loop” type that also use $O(1)$ samples at each iteration and still achieve
  the best-known complexity guarantees.'
