title: Quantifying Uncertainty in Natural Language Explanations of Large Language
  Models
software: https://github.com/harsha070/uncertainty-quantification-nle
abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as powerful tools for
  several high-stakes natural language processing (NLP) applications. Recent prompting
  works claim to elicit intermediate reasoning steps and key tokens that serve as
  proxy explanations for LLM predictions. However, there is no certainty whether these
  explanations are reliable and reflect the LLM’s behavior. In this work, we make
  one of the first attempts at quantifying the uncertainty in explanations of LLMs.
  To this end, we propose two novel metrics — Verbalized Uncertainty and Probing Uncertainty
  — to quantify the uncertainty of generated explanations. While verbalized uncertainty
  involves prompting the LLM to express its confidence in its explanations, probing
  uncertainty leverages sample and model perturbations as a means to quantify the
  uncertainty. Our empirical analysis of benchmark datasets reveals that verbalized
  uncertainty is not a reliable estimate of explanation confidence. Further, we show
  that the probing uncertainty estimates are correlated with the faithfulness of an
  explanation, with lower uncertainty corresponding to explanations with higher faithfulness.
  Our study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities of quantifying
  uncertainty in LLM explanations, contributing to the broader discussion of the trustworthiness
  of foundation models.
