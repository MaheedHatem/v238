title: Consistent and Asymptotically Unbiased Estimation of Proper Calibration Errors
software: https://github.com/tpopordanoska/proper-calibration-error
abstract: Proper scoring rules evaluate the quality of probabilistic predictions,
  playing an essential role in the pursuit of accurate and well-calibrated models.
  Every proper score decomposes into two fundamental components – proper calibration
  error and refinement – utilizing a Bregman divergence. While uncertainty calibration
  has gained significant attention, current literature lacks a general estimator for
  these quantities with known statistical properties. To address this gap, we propose
  a method that allows consistent, and asymptotically unbiased estimation of all proper
  calibration errors and refinement terms. In particular, we introduce Kullback-Leibler
  calibration error, induced by the commonly used cross-entropy loss. As part of our
  results, we prove the relation between refinement and f-divergences, which implies
  information monotonicity in neural networks, regardless of which proper scoring
  rule is optimized. Our experiments validate empirically the claimed properties of
  the proposed estimator and suggest that the selection of a post-hoc calibration
  method should be determined by the particular calibration error of interest.
