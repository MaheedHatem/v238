title: Learning multivariate temporal point processes via the time-change theorem
software: https://github.com/NUS-IDS/multi-ttpp
abstract: Marked temporal point processes (TPPs) are a class of stochastic processes
  that describe the occurrence of a countable number of marked events over continuous
  time. In machine learning, the most common representation of marked TPPs is the
  univariate TPP coupled with a conditional mark distribution. Alternatively, we can
  represent marked TPPs as a multivariate temporal point process in which we model
  each sequence of marks interdependently. We introduce a learning framework for multivariate
  TPPs leveraging recent progress on learning univariate TPPs via time-change theorems
  to propose a deep-learning, invertible model for the conditional intensity. We rely
  neither on Monte Carlo approximation for the compensator nor on thinning for sampling.
  Therefore, we have a generative model that can efficiently sample the next event
  given a history of past events. Our models show strong alignment between the percentiles
  of the distribution expected from theory and the empirical ones.
