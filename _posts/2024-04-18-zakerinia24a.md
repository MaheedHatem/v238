title: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning With Data and Client Heterogeneity
abstract: 'Federated Learning (FL) enables large-scale distributed training of machine
  learning models, while still allowing individual nodes to maintain data locally.
  However, executing FL at scale comes with inherent practical challenges: 1) heterogeneity
  of the local node data distributions, 2) heterogeneity of node computational speeds
  (asynchrony), but also 3) constraints in the amount of communication between the
  clients and the server. In this work, we present the first variant of the classic
  federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm which, at the same time, supports data heterogeneity,
  partial client asynchrony, and communication compression. Our algorithm comes with
  a novel, rigorous analysis showing that, in spite of these system relaxations, it
  can provide similar convergence to FedAvg in interesting parameter regimes. Experimental
  results in the rigorous LEAF benchmark on setups of up to $300$ nodes show that
  our algorithm ensures fast convergence for standard federated tasks, improving upon
  prior quantized and asynchronous approaches.'
