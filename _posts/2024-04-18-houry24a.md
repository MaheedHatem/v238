title: Fast 1-Wasserstein distance approximations using greedy strategies
abstract: 'Among numerous linear approximation methods proposed for optimal transport
  (OT), tree-based methods appear to be fairly reliable, notably for language processing
  applications. Inspired by these tree methods, we introduce several greedy heuristics
  aiming to compute even faster approximations of OT. We first explicitly establish
  the equivalence between greedy matching and optimal transport for tree metrics,
  and then we show that tree greedy matching can be reduced to greedy matching on
  a one-dimensional line. Next, we propose two new greedy-based algorithms in one
  dimension: the $k$-Greedy and 1D-ICT algorithms. This novel approach provides Wasserstein
  approximations with accuracy similar to the original tree methods on text datasets
  while being faster in practice. Finally, these algorithms are applicable beyond
  tree approximations: using sliced projections of the original data still provides
  fairly good accuracy while eliminating the need for embedding the data in a fixed
  and rigid tree structure. This property makes these approaches even more versatile
  than the original tree OT methods.'
