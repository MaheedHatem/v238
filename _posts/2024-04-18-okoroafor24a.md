title: Faster Recalibration of an Online Predictor via Approachability
abstract: Predictive models in ML need to be trustworthy and reliable, which often
  at the very least means outputting calibrated probabilities. This can be particularly
  difficult to guarantee in the online prediction setting when the outcome sequence
  can be generated adversarially. In this paper we introduce a technique using Blackwellâ€™s
  approachability theorem for taking an online predictive model which might not be
  calibrated and transforming its predictions to calibrated predictions without much
  increase to the loss of the original model. Our proposed algorithm achieves calibration
  and accuracy at a faster rate than existing techniques (Kuleshov and Ermon, 2017)
  and is the first algorithm to offer a flexible tradeoff between calibration error
  and accuracy in the online setting. We demonstrate this by characterizing the space
  of jointly achievable calibration and regret using our technique.
