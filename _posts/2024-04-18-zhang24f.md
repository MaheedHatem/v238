title: Online Learning in Contextual Second-Price Pay-Per-Click Auctions
abstract: 'We study online learning in contextual pay-per-click auctions where at
  each of the $T$ rounds, the learner receives some context along with a set of ads
  and needs to make an estimate on their click-through rate (CTR) in order to run
  a second-price pay-per-click auction. The learnerâ€™s goal is to minimize her regret,
  defined as the gap between her total revenue and that of an oracle strategy that
  always makes perfect CTR predictions. We first show that $\sqrt{T}$-regret is obtainable
  via a computationally inefficient algorithm and that it is unavoidable since our
  algorithm is no easier than the classical multi-armed bandit problem. A by-product
  of our results is a $\sqrt{T}$-regret bound for the simpler non-contextual setting,
  improving upon a recent work of [Feng et al., 2023] by removing the inverse CTR
  dependency that could be arbitrarily large. Then, borrowing ideas from recent advances
  on efficient contextual bandit algorithms, we develop two practically efficient
  contextual auction algorithms: the first one uses the exponential weight scheme
  with optimistic square errors and maintains the same $\sqrt{T}$-regret bound, while
  the second one reduces the problem to online regression via a simple epsilon-greedy
  strategy, albeit with a worse regret bound. Finally, we conduct experiments on a
  synthetic dataset to showcase the effectiveness and superior performance of our
  algorithms.'
