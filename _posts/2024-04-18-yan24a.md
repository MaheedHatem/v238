title: Causal Bandits with General Causal Models and Interventions
software: https://github.com/ZiruiYan/General-Causal-Bandit
abstract: This paper considers causal bandits (CBs) for the sequential design of interventions
  in a causal system. The objective is to optimize a reward function via minimizing
  a measure of cumulative regret with respect to the best sequence of interventions
  in hindsight. The paper advances the results on CBs in three directions. First,
  the structural causal models (SCMs) are assumed to be unknown and drawn arbitrarily
  from a general class $\mathcal{F}$ of Lipschitz-continuous functions. Existing results
  are often focused on (generalized) linear SCMs. Second, the interventions are assumed
  to be generalized soft with any desired level of granularity, resulting in an infinite
  number of possible interventions. The existing literature, in contrast, generally
  adopts atomic and hard interventions. Third, we provide general upper and lower
  bounds on regret. The upper bounds subsume (and improve) known bounds for special
  cases. The lower bounds are generally hitherto unknown. These bounds are characterized
  as functions of the (i) graph parameters, (ii) eluder dimension of the space of
  SCMs, denoted by $\mathrm{dim}(\mathcal{F})$, and (iii) the covering number of the
  function space, denoted by $\mathrm{cn}(\mathcal{F})$. Specifically, the cumulative
  achievable regret over horizon $T$ is $\mathcal{O}(K d^{L-1}\sqrt{T\,\mathrm{dim}(\mathcal{F})
  \log(\mathrm{cn}(\mathcal{F}))})$, where $K$ is related to the Lipschitz constants,
  $d$ is the graph’s maximum in-degree, and $L$ is the length of the longest causal
  path. The upper bound is further refined for special classes of SCMs (neural network,
  polynomial, and linear), and their corresponding lower bounds are provided.
