title: A Scalable Algorithm for Individually Fair k-Means Clustering
software: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/individually_fair_clustering/
abstract: We present a scalable algorithm for the individually fair ($p$, $k$)-clustering
  problem introduced by Jung et al. and Mahabadi et al. Given $n$ points $P$ in a
  metric space, let $\delta(x)$ for $x\in P$ be the radius of the smallest ball around
  $x$ containing at least $n / k$ points. A clustering is then called individually
  fair if it has centers within distance $\delta(x)$ of $x$ for each $x\in P$. While
  good approximation algorithms are known for this problem no efficient practical
  algorithms with good theoretical guarantees have been presented. We design the first
  fast local-search algorithm that runs in Â $O(nk^2)$ time and obtains a bicriteria
  $(O(1), 6)$ approximation. Then we show empirically that not only is our algorithm
  much faster than prior work, but it also produces lower-cost solutions.
