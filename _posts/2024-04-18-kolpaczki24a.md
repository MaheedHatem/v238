title: 'SVARM-IQ: Efficient Approximation of Any-order Shapley Interactions through
  Stratification'
software: https://github.com/kolpaczki/svarm-iq
abstract: Addressing the limitations of individual attribution scores via the Shapley
  value (SV), the field of explainable AI (XAI) has recently explored intricate interactions
  of features or data points. In particular, extensions of the SV, such as the Shapley
  Interaction Index (SII), have been proposed as a measure to still benefit from the
  axiomatic basis of the SV. However, similar to the SV, their exact computation remains
  computationally prohibitive. Hence, we propose with SVARM-IQ a sampling-based approach
  to efficiently approximate Shapley-based interaction indices of any order. SVARM-IQ
  can be applied to a broad class of interaction indices, including the SII, by leveraging
  a novel stratified representation. We provide non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees
  on its approximation quality and empirically demonstrate that SVARM-IQ achieves
  state-of-the-art estimation results in practical XAI scenarios on different model
  classes and application domains.
