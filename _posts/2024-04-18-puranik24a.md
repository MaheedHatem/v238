  Perspective'

abstract: State-of-the-art techniques for enhancing robustness of deep networks mostly
  rely on empirical risk minimization with suitable data augmentation. In this paper,
  we propose a complementary approach motivated by communication theory, aimed at
  enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio at the output of a neural network layer via
  neural competition during learning and inference. In addition to standard empirical
  risk minimization, neurons compete to sparsely represent layer inputs by maximization
  of a tilted exponential (TEXP) objective function for the layer. TEXP learning can
  be interpreted as maximum likelihood estimation of matched filters under a Gaussian
  model for data noise. Inference in a TEXP layer is accomplished by replacing batch
  norm by a tilted softmax, which can be interpreted as computation of posterior probabilities
  for the competing signaling hypotheses represented by each neuron. After providing
  insights via simplified models, we show, by experimentation on standard image datasets,
  that TEXP learning and inference enhances robustness against noise and other common
  corruptions, without requiring data augmentation. Further cumulative gains in robustness
  against this array of distortions can be obtained by appropriately combining TEXP
  with data augmentation techniques. The code for all our experiments is available
  at \url{https://github.com/bhagyapuranik/texp_for_robustness}.
