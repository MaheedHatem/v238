title: Optimal Budgeted Rejection Sampling for Generative Models
software: https://github.com/AlexVerine/RejectBigGan
abstract: Rejection sampling methods have recently been proposed to improve the performance
  of discriminator-based generative models. However, these methods are only optimal
  under an unlimited sampling budget, and are usually applied to a generator trained
  independently of the rejection procedure. We first propose an Optimal Budgeted Rejection
  Sampling (OBRS) scheme that is provably optimal with respect to \textit{any} $f$-divergence
  between the true distribution and the post-rejection distribution, for a given sampling
  budget. Second, we propose an end-to-end method that incorporates the sampling scheme
  into the training procedure to further enhance the modelâ€™s overall performance.
  Through experiments and supporting theory, we show that the proposed methods are
  effective in significantly improving the quality and diversity of the samples.
