title: 'DNNLasso: Scalable Graph Learning for Matrix-Variate Data'
software: https://github.com/YangjingZhang/DNNLasso
abstract: We consider the problem of jointly learning row-wise and column-wise dependencies
  of matrix-variate observations, which are modelled separately by two precision matrices.
  Due to the complicated structure of Kronecker-product precision matrices in the
  commonly used matrix-variate Gaussian graphical models, a sparser Kronecker-sum
  structure was proposed recently based on the Cartesian product of graphs. However,
  existing methods for estimating Kronecker-sum structured precision matrices do not
  scale well to large scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce DNNLasso, a diagonally
  non-negative graphical lasso model for estimating the Kronecker-sum structured precision
  matrix, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in both
  accuracy and computational time.
