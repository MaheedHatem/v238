title: Computing epidemic metrics with edge differential privacy
abstract: Metrics such as the outbreak size in an epidemic process on a network are
  fundamental quantities used in public health analyses. The datasets used in such
  models used in practice, e.g., the contact network and disease states, are sensitive
  in many settings. We study the complexity of computing epidemic outbreak size within
  a given time horizon, under edge differential privacy. These quantities have high
  sensitivity, and we show that giving algorithms with good utility guarantees is
  impossible for general graphs. To address these hardness results, we consider a
  smaller class of graphs with similar properties as social networks (called expander
  graphs) and give a polynomial-time algorithm with strong utility guarantees. Our
  results are the first to give any non-trivial guarantees for differentially private
  infection size estimation.
