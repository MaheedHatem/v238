abstract: 'Bilevel optimization aims to optimize an outer objective function that
  depends on the solution to an inner optimization problem. It is routinely used in
  Machine Learning, notably for hyperparameter tuning. The conventional method to
  compute the so-called hypergradient of the outer problem is to use the Implicit
  Function Theorem (IFT). As a function of the error of the inner problem resolution,
  we study the error of the IFT method. We analyze two strategies to reduce this error:
  preconditioning the IFT formula and reparameterizing the inner problem. We give
  a detailed account of the impact of these two modifications on the error, highlighting
  the role played by higher-order derivatives of the functionals at stake. Our theoretical
  findings explain when super efficiency, namely reaching an error on the hypergradient
  that depends quadratically on the error on the inner problem, is achievable and
  compare the two approaches when this is impossible. Numerical evaluations on hyperparameter
  tuning for regression problems substantiate our theoretical findings.'
