title: Towards a Complete Benchmark on Video Moment Localization
software: https://github.com/snuviplab/MoLEF
abstract: In this paper, we propose and conduct a comprehensive benchmark on moment
  localization task, which aims to retrieve a segment that corresponds to a text query
  from a single untrimmed video. Our study starts from an observation that most moment
  localization papers report experimental results only on a few datasets in spite
  of availability of far more benchmarks. Thus, we conduct an extensive benchmark
  study to measure the performance of representative methods on widely used 7 datasets.
  Looking further into the details, we pose additional research questions and empirically
  verify them, including if they rely on unintended biases introduced by specific
  training data, if advanced visual features trained on classification task transfer
  well to this task, and if computational cost of each model pays off. With a series
  of these experiments, we provide multi-faceted evaluation of state-of-the-art moment
  localization models. Codes are available at \url{https://github.com/snuviplab/MoLEF}.
