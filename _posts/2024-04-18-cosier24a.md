title: A Unifying Variational Framework for Gaussian Process Motion Planning
software: https://github.com/luke-ck/vgpmp
abstract: To control how a robot moves, motion planning algorithms must compute paths
  in high-dimensional state spaces while accounting for physical constraints related
  to motors and joints, generating smooth and stable motions, avoiding obstacles,
  and preventing collisions. A motion planning algorithm must therefore balance competing
  demands, and should ideally incorporate uncertainty to handle noise, model errors,
  and facilitate deployment in complex environments. To address these issues, we introduce
  a framework for robot motion planning based on variational Gaussian processes, which
  unifies and generalizes various probabilistic-inference-based motion planning algorithms,
  and connects them with optimization-based planners. Our framework provides a principled
  and flexible way to incorporate equality-based, inequality-based, and soft motion-planning
  constraints during end-to-end training, is straightforward to implement, and provides
  both interval-based and Monte-Carlo-based uncertainty estimates. We conduct experiments
  using different environments and robots, comparing against baseline approaches based
  on the feasibility of the planned paths, and obstacle avoidance quality. Results
  show that our proposed approach yields a good balance between success rates and
  path quality.
