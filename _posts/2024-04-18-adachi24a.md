title: 'Looping in the Human: Collaborative and Explainable Bayesian Optimization'
software: https://github.com/ma921/CoExBO
abstract: Like many optimizers, Bayesian optimization often falls short of gaining
  user trust due to opacity. While attempts have been made to develop human-centric
  optimizers, they typically assume user knowledge is well-specified and error-free,
  employing users mainly as supervisors of the optimization process. We relax these
  assumptions and propose a more balanced human-AI partnership with our Collaborative
  and Explainable Bayesian Optimization (CoExBO) framework. Instead of explicitly
  requiring a user to provide a knowledge model, CoExBO employs preference learning
  to seamlessly integrate human insights into the optimization, resulting in algorithmic
  suggestions that resonate with user preference. CoExBO explains its candidate selection
  every iteration to foster trust, empowering users with a clearer grasp of the optimization.
  Furthermore, CoExBO offers a no-harm guarantee, allowing users to make mistakes;
  even with extreme adversarial interventions, the algorithm converges asymptotically
  to a vanilla Bayesian optimization. We validate CoExBOâ€™s efficacy through human-AI
  teaming experiments in lithium-ion battery design, highlighting substantial improvements
  over conventional methods. Code is available https://github.com/ma921/CoExBO.
