title: Corruption-Robust Offline Two-Player Zero-Sum Markov Games
abstract: We study data corruption robustness in offline two-player zero-sum Markov
  games. Given a dataset of realized trajectories of two players, an adversary is
  allowed to modify an $\epsilon$-fraction of it. The learnerâ€™s goal is to identify
  an approximate Nash Equilibrium policy pair from the corrupted data. We consider
  this problem in linear Markov games under different degrees of data coverage and
  corruption. We start by providing an information-theoretic lower bound on the suboptimality
  gap of any learner. Next, we propose robust versions of the Pessimistic Minimax
  Value Iteration algorithm (Zhong et al., 2022), both under coverage on the corrupted
  data and under coverage only on the clean data, and show that they achieve (near)-optimal
  suboptimality gap bounds with respect to $\epsilon$. We note that we are the first
  to provide such a characterization of the problem of learning approximate Nash Equilibrium
  policies in offline two-player zero-sum Markov games under data corruption.
