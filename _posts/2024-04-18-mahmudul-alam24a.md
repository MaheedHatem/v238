title: Holographic Global Convolutional Networks for Long-Range Prediction Tasks in
  Malware Detection
software: https://github.com/FutureComputing4AI/HGConv
abstract: Malware detection is an interesting and valuable domain to work in because
  it has significant real-world impact and unique machine-learning challenges. We
  investigate existing long-range techniques and benchmarks and find that theyâ€™re
  not very suitable in this problem area. In this paper, we introduce Holographic
  Global Convolutional Networks (HGConv) that utilize the properties of Holographic
  Reduced Representations (HRR) to encode and decode features from sequence elements.
  Unlike other global convolutional methods, our method does not require any intricate
  kernel computation or crafted kernel design. HGConv kernels are defined as simple
  parameters learned through backpropagation. The proposed method has achieved new
  SOTA results on Microsoft Malware Classification Challenge, Drebin, and EMBER malware
  benchmarks. With log-linear complexity in sequence length, the empirical results
  demonstrate substantially faster run-time by HGConv compared to other methods achieving
  far more efficient scaling even with sequence length $\geq 100,000$.
