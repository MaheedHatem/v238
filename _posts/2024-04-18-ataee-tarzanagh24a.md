  Methods'
software: https://github.com/bojianhou/oagd
abstract: This paper introduces \textit{online bilevel optimization} in which a sequence
  of time-varying bilevel problems is revealed one after the other. We extend the
  known regret bounds for single-level online algorithms to the bilevel setting. Specifically,
  we provide new notions of \textit{bilevel regret}, develop an online alternating
  time-averaged gradient method that is capable of leveraging smoothness, and give
  regret bounds in terms of the path-length of the inner and outer minimizer sequences.
