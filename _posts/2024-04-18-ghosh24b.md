title: Sample-efficient neural likelihood-free Bayesian inference of implicit HMMs
software: https://github.com/sg5g10/HMM
abstract: Likelihood-free inference methods based on neural conditional density estimation
  were shown to drastically reduce the simulation burden in comparison to classical
  methods such as ABC. When applied in the context of any latent variable model, such
  as a Hidden Markov model (HMM), these methods are designed to only estimate the
  parameters, rather than the joint distribution of the parameters and the hidden
  states. Naive application of these methods to a HMM, ignoring the inference of this
  joint posterior distribution, will thus produce an inaccurate estimate of the posterior
  predictive distribution, in turn hampering the assessment of goodness-of-fit. To
  rectify this problem, we propose a novel, sample-efficient likelihood-free method
  for estimating the high-dimensional hidden states of an implicit HMM. Our approach
  relies on learning directly the intractable posterior distribution of the hidden
  states, using an autoregressive-flow, by exploiting the Markov property. Upon evaluating
  our approach on some implicit HMMs, we found that the quality of the estimates retrieved
  using our method is comparable to what can be achieved using a much more computationally
  expensive SMC algorithm.
