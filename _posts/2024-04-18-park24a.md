title: Density Uncertainty Layers for Reliable Uncertainty Estimation
software: https://github.com/yookoon/density_uncertainty_layers
abstract: 'Assessing the predictive uncertainty of deep neural networks is crucial
  for safety-related applications of deep learning. Although Bayesian deep learning
  offers a principled framework for estimating model uncertainty, the common approaches
  that approximate the parameter posterior often fail to deliver reliable estimates
  of predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel criterion for reliable
  predictive uncertainty: a modelâ€™s predictive variance should be grounded in the
  empirical density of the input. That is, the model should produce higher uncertainty
  for inputs that are improbable in the training data and lower uncertainty for inputs
  that are more probable. To operationalize this criterion, we develop the density
  uncertainty layer, a stochastic neural network architecture that satisfies the density
  uncertain criterion by design. We study density uncertainty layers on the UCI and
  CIFAR-10/100 uncertainty benchmarks. Compared to existing approaches, density uncertainty
  layers provide more reliable uncertainty estimates and robust out-of-distribution
  detection performance.'
