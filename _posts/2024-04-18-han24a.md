title: 'Robust SVD Made Easy: A fast and reliable algorithm for large-scale data analysis'
abstract: The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a crucial tool in machine learning
  and statistical data analysis. However, it is highly susceptible to outliers in
  the data matrix. Existing robust SVD algorithms often sacrifice speed for robustness
  or fail in the presence of only a few outliers. This study introduces an efficient
  algorithm, called Spherically Normalized SVD, for robust SVD approximation that
  is highly insensitive to outliers, computationally scalable, and provides accurate
  approximations of singular vectors. The proposed algorithm achieves remarkable speed
  by utilizing only two applications of a standard reduced-rank SVD algorithm to appropriately
  scaled data, significantly outperforming competing algorithms in computation times.
  To assess the robustness of the approximated singular vectors and their subspaces
  against data contamination, we introduce new notions of breakdown points for matrix-valued
  input, including row-wise, column-wise, and block-wise breakdown points. Theoretical
  and empirical analyses demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits higher breakdown
  points compared to standard SVD and its modifications. We empirically validate the
  effectiveness of our approach in applications such as robust low-rank approximation
  and robust principal component analysis of high-dimensional microarray datasets.
  Overall, our study presents a highly efficient and robust solution for SVD approximation
  that overcomes the limitations of existing algorithms in the presence of outliers.
