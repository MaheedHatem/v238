title: Private Learning with Public Features
software: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/dp_alternating_minimization
abstract: We study a class of private learning problems in which the data is a join
  of private and public features. This is often the case in private personalization
  tasks such as recommendation or ad prediction, in which features related to individuals
  are sensitive, while features related to items (the movies or songs to be recommended,
  or the ads to be shown to users) are publicly available and do not require protection.
  A natural question is whether private algorithms can achieve higher utility in the
  presence of public features. We give a positive answer for multi-encoder models
  where one of the encoders operates on public features. We develop new algorithms
  that take advantage of this separation by only protecting certain sufficient statistics
  (instead of adding noise to the gradient). This method has a guaranteed utility
  improvement for linear regression, and importantly, achieves the state of the art
  on two standard private recommendation benchmarks, demonstrating the importance
  of methods that adapt to the private-public feature separation.
