title: Importance Matching Lemma for Lossy Compression with Side Information
software: https://github.com/truongbuu/IML_Experiment
abstract: We propose two extensions to existing importance sampling based methods
  for lossy compression. First, we introduce an importance sampling based compression
  scheme that is a variant of ordered random coding (Theis and Ahmed, 2022) and is
  amenable to direct evaluation of the achievable compression rate for a finite number
  of samples. Our second and major contribution is the \emph{importance matching lemma},
  which is a finite proposal counterpart of the recently introduced {Poisson matching
  lemma} (Li and Anantharam, 2021). By integrating with deep learning, we provide
  a new coding scheme for distributed lossy compression with side information at the
  decoder. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through experiments
  involving synthetic Gaussian sources, distributed image compression with MNIST and
  vertical federated learning with CIFAR-10.
