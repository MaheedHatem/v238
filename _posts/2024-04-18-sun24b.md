title: Sparse and Faithful Explanations Without Sparse Models
software: https://github.com/williamsyy/SparseExplanationValues
abstract: Even if a model is not globally sparse, it is possible for decisions made
  from that model to be accurately and faithfully described by a small number of features.
  For instance, an application for a large loan might be denied to someone because
  they have no credit history, which overwhelms any evidence towards their creditworthiness.
  In this work, we introduce the Sparse Explanation Value (SEV), a new way of measuring
  sparsity in machine learning models. In the loan denial example above, the SEV is
  1 because only one factor is needed to explain why the loan was denied. SEV is a
  measure of decision sparsity rather than overall model sparsity, and we are able
  to show that many machine learning models – even if they are not sparse – actually
  have low decision sparsity, as measured by SEV. SEV is defined using movements over
  a hypercube, allowing SEV to be defined consistently over various model classes,
  with movement restrictions reflecting real-world constraints. Our algorithms reduce
  SEV without sacrificing accuracy, providing sparse and completely faithful explanations,
  even without globally sparse models.
