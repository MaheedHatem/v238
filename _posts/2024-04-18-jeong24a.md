title: On-Demand Federated Learning for Arbitrary Target Class Distributions
software: https://github.com/eai-lab/On-DemandFL
abstract: We introduce On-Demand Federated Learning (On-Demand FL), which enables
  on-demand federated learning of a deep model for an arbitrary target data distribution
  of interest by making the best use of the heterogeneity (non-IID-ness) of local
  client data, unlike existing approaches trying to circumvent the non-IID nature
  of federated learning. On-Demand FL composes a dataset of the target distribution,
  which we call the composite dataset, from a selected subset of local clients whose
  aggregate distribution is expected to emulate the target distribution as a whole.
  As the composite dataset consists of a precise yet diverse subset of clients reflecting
  the target distribution, the on-demand model trained with exactly enough selected
  clients becomes able to improve the model performance on the target distribution
  compared when trained with off-target and/or unknown distributions while reducing
  the number of participating clients and federating rounds. We model the target data
  distribution in terms of class and estimate the class distribution of each local
  client from the weight gradient of its local model. Our experiment results show
  that On-Demand FL achieves up to 5% higher classification accuracy on various target
  distributions just involving 9${\times}$ fewer clients with FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
  and CIFAR-100.
