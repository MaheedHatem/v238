title: Robust variance-regularized risk minimization with concomitant scaling
software: https://github.com/feedbackward/bdd-mv
abstract: Under losses which are potentially heavy-tailed, we consider the task of
  minimizing sums of the loss mean and standard deviation, without trying to accurately
  estimate the variance. By modifying a technique for variance-free robust mean estimation
  to fit our problem setting, we derive a simple learning procedure which can be easily
  combined with standard gradient-based solvers to be used in traditional machine
  learning workflows. Empirically, we verify that our proposed approach, despite its
  simplicity, performs as well or better than even the best-performing candidates
  derived from alternative criteria such as CVaR or DRO risks on a variety of datasets.
