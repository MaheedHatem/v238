title: On the estimation of persistence intensity functions and linear representations
  of persistence diagrams
software: https://github.com/Weichen-Wu-CMU/estimation_of_persistence_intensity_function
abstract: Persistence diagrams are one of the most popular types of data summaries
  used in Topological Data Analysis. The prevailing statistical approach to analyzing
  persistence diagrams is concerned with filtering out topological noise. In this
  paper, we adopt a different viewpoint and aim at estimating the actual distribution
  of a random persistence diagram, which captures both topological signal and noise.
  To that effect, Chazel et al., (2018) proved that, under general conditions, the
  expected value of a random persistence diagram is a measure admitting a Lebesgue
  density, called the persistence intensity function. In this paper, we are concerned
  with estimating the persistence intensity function and a novel, normalized version
  of it â€“ called the persistence density function. We present a class of kernel-based
  estimators based on an i.i.d. sample of persistence diagrams and derive estimation
  rates in the supremum norm. As a direct corollary, we obtain uniform consistency
  rates for estimating linear representations of persistence diagrams, including Betti
  numbers and persistence surfaces. Interestingly, the persistence density function
  delivers stronger statistical guarantees.
