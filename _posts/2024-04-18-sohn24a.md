title: Fair Supervised Learning with A Simple Random Sampler of Sensitive Attributes
software: https://github.com/jwsohn612/fairSBP
abstract: As the data-driven decision process becomes dominating for industrial applications,
  fairness-aware machine learning arouses great attention in various areas. This work
  proposes fairness penalties learned by neural networks with a simple random sampler
  of sensitive attributes for non-discriminatory supervised learning. In contrast
  to many existing works that critically rely on the discreteness of sensitive attributes
  and response variables, the proposed penalty is able to handle versatile formats
  of the sensitive attributes, so it is more extensively applicable in practice than
  many existing algorithms. This penalty enables us to build a computationally efficient
  group-level in-processing fairness-aware training framework. Empirical evidence
  shows that our framework enjoys better utility and fairness measures on popular
  benchmark data sets than competing methods. We also theoretically characterize estimation
  errors and loss of utility of the proposed neural-penalized risk minimization problem.
