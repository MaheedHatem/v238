title: Learning Sparse Codes with Entropy-Based ELBOs
software: https://github.com/Learning-with-Entropies/sparse-coding.git
abstract: 'Standard probabilistic sparse coding assumes a Laplace prior, a linear
  mapping from latents to observables, and Gaussian observable distributions. We here
  derive a solely entropy-based learning objective for the parameters of standard
  sparse coding. The novel variational objective has the following features: (A) unlike
  MAP approximations, it uses non-trivial posterior approximations for probabilistic
  inference; (B) the novel objective is fully analytic; and (C) the objective allows
  for a novel principled form of annealing. The objective is derived by first showing
  that the standard ELBO objective converges to a sum of entropies, which matches
  similar recent results for generative models with Gaussian priors. The conditions
  under which the ELBO becomes equal to entropies are then shown to have analytic
  solutions, which leads to the fully analytic objective. Numerical experiments are
  used to demonstrate the feasibility of learning with such entropy-based ELBOs. We
  investigate different posterior approximations including Gaussians with correlated
  latents and deep amortized approximations. Furthermore, we numerically investigate
  entropy-based annealing which results in improved learning. Our main contributions
  are theoretical, however, and they are twofold: (1) we provide the first demonstration
  on how a recently shown convergence of the ELBO to entropy sums can be used for
  learning; and (2) using the entropy objective, we derive a fully analytic ELBO objective
  for the standard sparse coding generative model.'
