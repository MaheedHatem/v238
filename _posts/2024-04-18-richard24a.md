title: Constant or Logarithmic Regret in Asynchronous Multiplayer Bandits with Limited
  Communication
software: https://github.com/hugorichard/mmab
abstract: Multiplayer bandits have recently garnered significant attention due to
  their relevance in cognitive radio networks. While the existing body of literature
  predominantly focuses on synchronous players, real-world radio networks, such as
  those in IoT applications, often feature asynchronous (i.e., randomly activated)
  devices. This highlights the need for addressing the more challenging asynchronous
  multiplayer bandits problem. Our first result shows that a natural extension of
  UCB achieves a minimax regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T\log(T)})$ in the centralized
  setting. More significantly, we introduce Cautious Greedy, which uses $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$
  communications and whose instance-dependent regret is constant if the optimal policy
  assigns at least one player to each arm (a situation proven to occur when arm means
  are sufficiently close). Otherwise, the regret is, as usual, $\log(T)$ times the
  sum of some inverse sub-optimality gaps. We substantiate the optimality of Cautious
  Greedy through lower-bound analysis based on data-dependent terms. Therefore, we
  establish a strong baseline for asynchronous multiplayer bandits, at least with
  $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$ communications.
