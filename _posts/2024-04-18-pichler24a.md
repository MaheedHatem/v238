title: On the (In)feasibility of ML Backdoor Detection as an Hypothesis Testing Problem
software: https://github.com/g-pichler/in_feasibility_of_ml_backdoor_detection
abstract: We introduce a formal statistical definition for the problem of backdoor
  detection in machine learning systems and use it to analyze the feasibility of such
  problems, providing evidence for the utility and applicability of our definition.
  The main contributions of this work are an impossibility result and an achievability
  result for backdoor detection. We show a no-free-lunch theorem, proving that universal
  (adversary-unaware) backdoor detection is impossible, except for very small alphabet
  sizes. Thus, we argue, that backdoor detection methods need to be either explicitly,
  or implicitly adversary-aware. However, our work does not imply that backdoor detection
  cannot work in specific scenarios, as evidenced by successful backdoor detection
  methods in the scientific literature. Furthermore, we connect our definition to
  the probably approximately correct (PAC) learnability of the out-of-distribution
  detection problem.
