title: 'Fitting ARMA Time Series Models without Identification: A Proximal Approach'
software: https://github.com/Yin-LIU/ARMA_identify_proximal
abstract: Fitting autoregressive moving average (ARMA) time series models requires
  model identification before parameter estimation. Model identification involves
  determining the order of the autoregressive and moving average components which
  is generally performed by inspection of the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation
  functions or other offline methods. In this work, we regularize the parameter estimation
  optimization problem with a non-smooth hierarchical sparsity-inducing penalty based
  on two path graphs that allow performing model identification and parameter estimation
  simultaneously. A proximal block coordinate descent algorithm is then proposed to
  solve the underlying optimization problem efficiently. The resulting model satisfies
  the required stationarity and invertibility conditions for ARMA models. Numerical
  results supporting the proposed method are also presented.
