title: Exploring the Power of Graph Neural Networks in Solving Linear Optimization
  Problems
software: https://github.com/chendiqian/IPM_MPNN
abstract: Recently, machine learning, particularly message-passing graph neural networks
  (MPNNs), has gained traction in enhancing exact optimization algorithms. For example,
  MPNNs speed up solving mixed-integer optimization problems by imitating computational
  intensive heuristics like strong branching, which entails solving multiple linear
  optimization problems (LPs). Despite the empirical success, the reasons behind MPNNs’
  effectiveness in emulating linear optimization remain largely unclear. Here, we
  show that MPNNs can simulate standard interior-point methods for LPs, explaining
  their practical success. Furthermore, we highlight how MPNNs can serve as a lightweight
  proxy for solving LPs, adapting to a given problem instance distribution. Empirically,
  we show that MPNNs solve LP relaxations of standard combinatorial optimization problems
  close to optimality, often surpassing conventional solvers and competing approaches
  in solving time.
