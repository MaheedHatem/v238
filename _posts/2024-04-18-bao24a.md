title: 'BOBA: Byzantine-Robust Federated Learning with Label Skewness'
software: https://github.com/baowenxuan/BOBA
abstract: In federated learning, most existing robust aggregation rules (AGRs) combat
  Byzantine attacks in the IID setting, where client data is assumed to be independent
  and identically distributed. In this paper, we address label skewness, a more realistic
  and challenging non-IID setting, where each client only has access to a few classes
  of data. In this setting, state-of-the-art AGRs suffer from selection bias, leading
  to significant performance drop for particular classes; they are also more vulnerable
  to Byzantine attacks due to the increased variation among gradients of honest clients.
  To address these limitations, we propose an efficient two-stage method named BOBA.
  Theoretically, we prove the convergence of BOBA with an error of the optimal order.
  Our empirical evaluations demonstrate BOBAâ€™s superior unbiasedness and robustness
  across diverse models and datasets when compared to various baselines.
