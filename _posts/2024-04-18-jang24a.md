  Learning'
software: https://github.com/Taeuk-Jang/FSNS
abstract: 'Fairness is a growing concern in machine learning as state-of-the-art models
  may amplify social prejudice by making biased predictions against specific demographics
  such as race and gender. Such discrimination raises issues in various fields such
  as employment, criminal justice, and trust score evaluation. To address the concerns,
  we propose learning fair representation through a straightforward yet effective
  approach to project intrinsic information while filtering sensitive information
  for downstream tasks. Our model consists of two goals: one is to ensure that the
  latent data from different demographic groups is non-separable (i.e., make the latent
  data distribution independent of the sensitive feature to improve fairness); the
  other is to maximize the separability of latent data from different classes (i.e.,
  maintain the discriminative power of data for the sake of the downstream tasks like
  classification). Our method adopts a non-zero-sum adversarial game to minimize the
  distance between data from different demographic groups while maximizing the margin
  between data from different classes. Moreover, the proposed objective function can
  be easily generalized to multiple sensitive attributes and multi-class scenarios
  as it upper bounds popular fairness metrics in these cases. We provide theoretical
  analysis of the fairness of our model and validate w.r.t. both fairness and predictive
  performance on benchmark datasets.'
