title: Graph fission and cross-validation
software: https://github.com/jamesleiner/graph_fission
abstract: 'We introduce a technique called graph fission which takes in a graph which
  potentially contains only one observation per node (whose distribution lies in a
  known class) and produces two (or more) independent graphs with the same node/edge
  set in a way that splits the original graph’s information amongst them in any desired
  proportion. Our proposal builds on data fission/thinning, a method that uses external
  randomization to create independent copies of an unstructured dataset. We extend
  this idea to the graph setting where there may be latent structure between observations.
  We demonstrate the utility of this framework via two applications: inference after
  structural trend estimation on graphs and a model selection procedure we term "graph
  cross-validation"’.'
