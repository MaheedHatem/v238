title: 'Submodular Minimax Optimization: Finding Effective Sets'
abstract: Despite the rich existing literature about minimax optimization in continuous
  settings, only very partial results of this kind have been obtained for combinatorial
  settings. In this paper, we fill this gap by providing a characterization of submodular
  minimax optimization, the problem of finding a set (for either the min or the max
  player) that is effective against every possible response. We show when and under
  what conditions we can find such sets. We also demonstrate how minimax submodular
  optimization provides robust solutions for downstream machine learning applications
  such as (i) prompt engineering in large language models, (ii) identifying robust
  waiting locations for ride-sharing, (iii) kernelization of the difficulty of instances
  of the last setting, and (iv) finding adversarial images. Our experiments show that
  our proposed algorithms consistently outperform other baselines.
