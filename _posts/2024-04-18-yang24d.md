title: Learning Unknown Intervention Targets in Structural Causal Models from Heterogeneous
  Data
software: https://github.com/Yuqin-Yang/LIT
abstract: We study the problem of identifying the unknown intervention targets in
  structural causal models where we have access to heterogeneous data collected from
  multiple environments. The unknown intervention targets are the set of endogenous
  variables whose corresponding exogenous noises change across the environments. We
  propose a two-phase approach which in the first phase recovers the exogenous noises
  corresponding to unknown intervention targets whose distributions have changed across
  environments. In the second phase, the recovered noises are matched with the corresponding
  endogenous variables. For the recovery phase, we provide sufficient conditions for
  learning these exogenous noises up to some component-wise invertible transformation.
  For the matching phase, under the causal sufficiency assumption, we show that the
  proposed method uniquely identifies the intervention targets. In the presence of
  latent confounders, the intervention targets among the observed variables cannot
  be determined uniquely. We provide a candidate intervention target set which is
  a superset of the true intervention targets. Our approach improves upon the state
  of the art as the returned candidate set is always a subset of the target set returned
  by previous work. Moreover, we do not require restrictive assumptions such as linearity
  of the causal model or performing invariance tests to learn whether a distribution
  is changing across environments which could be highly sample inefficient. Our experimental
  results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in practice.
