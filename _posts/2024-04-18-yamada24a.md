title: Learning Fair Division from Bandit Feedback
software: https://github.com/nanahaku/DA-bandit
abstract: This work addresses learning online fair division under uncertainty, where
  a central planner sequentially allocates items without precise knowledge of agents’
  values or utilities. Departing from conventional online algorithms, the planner
  here relies on noisy, estimated values obtained after allocating items. We introduce
  wrapper algorithms utilizing dual averaging, enabling gradual learning of both the
  type distribution of arriving items and agents’ values through bandit feedback.
  This approach enables the algorithms to asymptotically achieve optimal Nash social
  welfare in linear Fisher markets with agents having additive utilities. We also
  empirically verify the performance of the proposed algorithms across synthetic and
  empirical datasets.
