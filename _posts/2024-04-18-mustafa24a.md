title: Non-vacuous Generalization Bounds for Adversarial Risk in Stochastic Neural
  Networks
software: https://github.com/waleedamustafa/nonadvgenaistats
abstract: Adversarial examples are manipulated samples used to deceive machine learning
  models, posing a serious threat in safety-critical applications. Existing safety
  certificates for machine learning models are limited to individual input examples,
  failing to capture generalization to unseen data. To address this limitation, we
  propose novel generalization bounds based on the PAC-Bayesian and randomized smoothing
  frameworks, providing certificates that predict the modelâ€™s performance and robustness
  on unseen test samples based solely on the training data. We present an effective
  procedure to train and compute the first non-vacuous generalization bounds for neural
  networks in adversarial settings. Experimental results on the widely recognized
  MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, yielding the
  first robust risk certificates for stochastic convolutional neural networks under
  the $L_2$ threat model. Our method offers valuable tools for evaluating model susceptibility
  to real-world adversarial risks.
