title: Fast Fourier Bayesian Quadrature
software: https://github.com/houstonwarren/ffbq
abstract: 'In numerical integration, Bayesian quadrature (BQ) excels at producing
  estimates with quantified uncertainties, particularly in sparse data settings. However,
  its computational scalability and kernel learning capabilities have lagged behind
  modern advances in Gaussian process research. To bridge this gap, we recast the
  BQ posterior integral as a convolution operation, which enables efficient computation
  via fast Fourier transform of low-rank matrices. We introduce two new methods enabled
  by recasting BQ as a convolution: fast Fourier Bayesian quadrature and sparse spectrum
  Bayesian quadrature. These methods enhance the computational scalability of BQ and
  expand kernel flexibility, enabling the use of \textit{any} stationary kernel in
  the BQ setting. We empirically validate the efficacy of our approach through a range
  of integration tasks, substantiating the benefits of the proposed methodology.'
