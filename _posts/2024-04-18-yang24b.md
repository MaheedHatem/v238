title: Orthogonal Gradient Boosting for Simpler Additive Rule Ensembles
software: https://github.com/fyan102/FCOGB
abstract: Gradient boosting of prediction rules is an efficient approach to learn
  potentially interpretable yet accurate probabilistic models. However, actual interpretability
  requires to limit the number and size of the generated rules, and existing boosting
  variants are not designed for this purpose. Though corrective boosting refits all
  rule weights in each iteration to minimise prediction risk, the included rule conditions
  tend to be sub-optimal, because commonly used objective functions fail to anticipate
  this refitting. Here, we address this issue by a new objective function that measures
  the angle between the risk gradient vector and the projection of the condition output
  vector onto the orthogonal complement of the already selected conditions. This approach
  correctly approximates the ideal update of adding the risk gradient itself to the
  model and favours the inclusion of more general and thus shorter rules. As we demonstrate
  using a wide range of prediction tasks, this significantly improves the comprehensibility/accuracy
  trade-off of the fitted ensemble. Additionally, we show how objective values for
  related rule conditions can be computed incrementally to avoid any substantial computational
  overhead of the new method.
