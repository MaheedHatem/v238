abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are gold standards for assessing intervention
  efficacy. Yet, generalizing evidence from classical RCTs can be challenging and
  sometimes problematic due to their limited external validity under stringent eligibility
  criteria and inadequate statistical power resulting from limited sample sizes under
  budgetary constraints. "Digital clinical trial," which utilizes digital technology
  and electronic medical records (EMRs) to expand eligibility criteria and enhance
  data collection efficiency, offers a promising concept for solving the above-mentioned
  conundrums encountered in classical RCTs. In this paper, we propose two novel digital
  clinical trial design strategies assisted by EMRs collected from diverse patient
  populations. On the one hand, leveraging digital technologies, our design strategies
  adaptively modify both the eligibility criteria and treatment assignment mechanism
  to enhance data collection efficiency. As a result, evidence gathered from our design
  can possess greater statistical power. On the other hand, since EMRs capture diverse
  patient populations and provide large sample sizes, our design not only broadens
  the trialâ€™s eligibility criteria but also enhances its statistical power, enabling
  us to collect more generalizable evidence with boosted statistical power for evaluating
  intervention efficacy than classical RCTs. We demonstrate the validity and merit
  of the proposed designs with detailed theoretical investigation, simulation studies,
  and a synthetic case study.
