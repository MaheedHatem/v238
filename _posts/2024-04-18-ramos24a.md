title: 'BlockBoost: Scalable and Efficient Blocking through Boosting'
software: https://github.com/thiagorr162/blockboost
abstract: As datasets grow larger, matching and merging entries from different databases
  has become a costly task in modern data pipelines. To avoid expensive comparisons
  between entries, blocking similar items is a popular preprocessing step. In this
  paper, we introduce BlockBoost, a novel boosting-based method that generates compact
  binary hash codes for database entries, through which blocking can be performed
  efficiently. The algorithm is fast and scalable, resulting in computational costs
  that are orders of magnitude lower than current benchmarks. Unlike existing alternatives,
  BlockBoost comes with associated feature importance measures for interpretability,
  and possesses strong theoretical guarantees, including lower bounds on critical
  performance metrics like recall and reduction ratio. Finally, we show that BlockBoost
  delivers great empirical results, outperforming state-of-the-art blocking benchmarks
  in terms of both performance metrics and computational cost.
