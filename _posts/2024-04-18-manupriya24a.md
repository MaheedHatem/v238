title: Consistent Optimal Transport with Empirical Conditional Measures
software: https://github.com/atmlr-lab/COT
abstract: Given samples from two joint distributions, we consider the problem of Optimal
  Transportation (OT) between them when conditioned on a common variable. We focus
  on the general setting where the conditioned variable may be continuous, and the
  marginals of this variable in the two joint distributions may not be the same. In
  such settings, standard OT variants cannot be employed, and novel estimation techniques
  are necessary. Since the main challenge is that the conditional distributions are
  not explicitly available, the key idea in our OT formulation is to employ kernelized-least-squares
  terms computed over the joint samples, which implicitly match the transport planâ€™s
  marginals with the empirical conditionals. Under mild conditions, we prove that
  our estimated transport plans, as a function of the conditioned variable, are asymptotically
  optimal. For finite samples, we show that the deviation in terms of our regularized
  objective is bounded by $O(m^{-1/4})$, where $m$ is the number of samples. We also
  discuss how the conditional transport plan could be modelled using explicit probabilistic
  models as well as using implicit generative ones. We empirically verify the consistency
  of our estimator on synthetic datasets, where the optimal plan is analytically known.
  When employed in applications like prompt learning for few-shot classification and
  conditional-generation in the context of predicting cell responses to treatment,
  our methodology improves upon state-of-the-art methods.
