title: Continual Domain Adversarial Adaptation via Double-Head Discriminators
software: https://github.com/yshen22/continual-domain-adversarial-adaptation
abstract: Domain adversarial adaptation in a continual setting poses significant challenges
  due to the limitations of accessing previous source domain data. Despite extensive
  research in continual learning, adversarial adaptation cannot be effectively accomplished
  using only a small number of stored source domain data, a standard setting in memory
  replay approaches. This limitation arises from the erroneous empirical estimation
  of $\mathcal{H}$-divergence with few source domain samples. To tackle this problem,
  we propose a double-head discriminator algorithm by introducing an addition source-only
  domain discriminator trained solely on the source learning phase. We prove that
  by introducing a pre-trained source-only domain discriminator, the empirical estimation
  error of $\mathcal{H}$-divergence related adversarial loss is reduced from the source
  domain side. Further experiments on existing domain adaptation benchmarks show that
  our proposed algorithm achieves more than 2$%$ improvement on all categories of
  target domain adaptation tasks while significantly mitigating the forgetting of
  the source domain.
