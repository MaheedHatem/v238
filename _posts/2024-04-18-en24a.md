title: Cross-model Mutual Learning for Exemplar-based Medical Image Segmentation
abstract: Medical image segmentation typically demands extensive dense annotations
  for model training, which is both time-consuming and skill-intensive. To mitigate
  this burden, exemplar-based medical image segmentation methods have been introduced
  to achieve effective training with only one annotated image. In this paper, we introduce
  a novel Cross-model Mutual learning framework for Exemplar-based Medical image Segmentation
  (CMEMS), which leverages two models to mutually excavate implicit information from
  unlabeled data at multiple granularities. CMEMS can eliminate confirmation bias
  and enable collaborative training to learn complementary information by enforcing
  consistency at different granularities across models. Concretely, cross-model image
  perturbation based mutual learning is devised by using weakly perturbed images to
  generate high-confidence pseudo-labels, supervising predictions of strongly perturbed
  images across models. This approach enables joint pursuit of prediction consistency
  at the image granularity. Moreover, cross-model multi-level feature perturbation
  based mutual learning is designed by letting pseudo-labels supervise predictions
  from perturbed multi-level features with different resolutions, which can broaden
  the perturbation space and enhance the robustness of our framework. CMEMS is jointly
  trained using exemplar data, synthetic data, and unlabeled data in an end-to-end
  manner. Experimental results on two medical image datasets indicate that the proposed
  CMEMS outperforms the state-of-the-art segmentation methods with extremely limited
  supervision.
