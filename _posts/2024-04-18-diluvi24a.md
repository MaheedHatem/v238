title: Mixed variational flows for discrete variables
software: https://github.com/giankdiluvi/madmix
abstract: Variational flows allow practitioners to learn complex continuous distributions,
  but approximating discrete distributions remains a challenge. Current methodologies
  typically embed the discrete target in a continuous space—usually via continuous
  relaxation or dequantization—and then apply a continuous flow. These approaches
  involve a surrogate target that may not capture the original discrete target, might
  have biased or unstable gradients, and can create a difficult optimization problem.
  In this work, we develop a variational flow family for discrete distributions without
  any continuous embedding. First, we develop a measure-preserving and discrete (MAD)
  invertible map that leaves the discrete target invariant, and then create a mixed
  variational flow (MAD Mix) based on that map. Our family provides access to i.i.d.
  sampling and density evaluation with virtually no tuning effort. We also develop
  an extension to MAD Mix that handles joint discrete and continuous models. Our experiments
  suggest that MAD Mix produces more reliable approximations than continuous-embedding
  flows while requiring orders of magnitude less compute.
