title: 'Non-Neighbors Also Matter to Kriging: A New Contrastive-Prototypical Learning'
software: https://github.com/zhshLii/KCP
abstract: 'Kriging aims to estimate the attributes of unseen geo-locations from observations
  in the spatial vicinity or physical connections. Existing works assume that neighborsâ€™
  information offers the basis for estimating the unobserved target while ignoring
  non-neighbors. However, neighbors could also be quite different or even misleading,
  and the non-neighbors could still offer constructive information. To this end, we
  propose "Contrastive-Prototypical" self-supervised learning for Kriging (KCP): (1)
  The neighboring contrastive module coarsely pushes neighbors together and non-neighbors
  apart. (2) In parallel, the prototypical module identifies similar representations
  via exchanged prediction, such that it refines the misleading neighbors and recycles
  the useful non-neighbors from the neighboring contrast component. As a result, not
  all the neighbors and some of the non-neighbors will be used to infer the target.
  (3) To learn general and robust representations, we design an adaptive augmentation
  module that encourages data diversity. Theoretical bound is derived for the proposed
  augmentation. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
  performance of KCP compared to its peers with 6% improvements and exceptional transferability
  and robustness.'
