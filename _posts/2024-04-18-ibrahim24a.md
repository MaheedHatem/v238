title: End-to-end Feature Selection Approach for Learning Skinny Trees
software: https://github.com/mazumder-lab/SkinnyTrees
abstract: 'We propose a new optimization-based approach for feature selection in tree
  ensembles, an important problem in statistics and machine learning. Popular tree
  ensemble toolkits e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees and Random Forests support feature
  selection post-training based on feature importance scores, while very popular,
  they are known to have drawbacks. We propose Skinny Trees: an end-to-end toolkit
  for feature selection in tree ensembles where we train a tree ensemble while controlling
  the number of selected features. Our optimization-based approach learns an ensemble
  of differentiable trees, and simultaneously performs feature selection using a grouped
  $\ell_0$-regularizer. We use first-order methods for optimization and present convergence
  guarantees for our approach. We use a dense-to-sparse regularization scheduling
  scheme that can lead to more expressive and sparser tree ensembles. On 15 synthetic
  and real-world datasets, Skinny Trees can achieve $1.5{\times}$â€“$620{\times}$ feature
  compression rates, leading up to $10{\times}$ faster inference over dense trees,
  without any loss in performance. Skinny Trees lead to superior feature selection
  than many existing toolkits e.g., in terms of AUC performance for 25% feature budget,
  Skinny Trees outperforms LightGBM by 10.2% (up to 37.7%), and Random Forests by
  3% (up to 12.5%).'
