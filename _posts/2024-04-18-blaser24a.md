title: Federated Linear Contextual Bandits with Heterogeneous Clients
software: https://github.com/blaserethan/HetoFedBandit
abstract: The demand for collaborative and private bandit learning across multiple
  agents is surging due to the growing quantity of data generated from distributed
  systems. Federated bandit learning has emerged as a promising framework for private,
  efficient, and decentralized online learning. However, almost all previous works
  rely on strong assumptions of client homogeneity, i.e., all participating clients
  shall share the same bandit model; otherwise, they all would suffer linear regret.
  This greatly restricts the application of federated bandit learning in practice.
  In this work, we introduce a new approach for federated bandits for heterogeneous
  clients, which clusters clients for collaborative bandit learning under the federated
  learning setting. Our proposed algorithm achieves non-trivial sub-linear regret
  and communication cost for all clients, subject to the communication protocol under
  federated learning that at anytime only one model can be shared by the server.
