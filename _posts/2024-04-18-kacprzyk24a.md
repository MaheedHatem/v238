abstract: Symbolic regression has excelled in uncovering equations from physics, chemistry,
  biology, and related disciplines. However, its effectiveness becomes less certain
  when applied to experimental data lacking inherent closed-form expressions. Empirically
  derived relationships, such as entire stress-strain curves, may defy concise closed-form
  representation, compelling us to explore more adaptive modeling approaches that
  balance flexibility with interpretability. In our pursuit, we turn to Generalized
  Additive Models (GAMs), a widely used class of models known for their versatility
  across various domains. Although GAMs can capture non-linear relationships between
  variables and targets, they cannot capture intricate feature interactions. In this
  work, we investigate both of these challenges and propose a novel class of models,
  Shape Arithmetic Expressions (SHAREs), that fuses GAM’s flexible shape functions
  with the complex feature interactions found in mathematical expressions. SHAREs
  also provide a unifying framework for both of these approaches. We also design a
  set of rules for constructing SHAREs that guarantee transparency of the found expressions
  beyond the standard constraints based on the model’s size.
