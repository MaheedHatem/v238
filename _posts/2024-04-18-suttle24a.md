title: Sampling-based Safe Reinforcement Learning for Nonlinear Dynamical Systems
software: https://github.com/sharma1256/cbf-constrained_ppo
abstract: 'We develop provably safe and convergent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
  for control of nonlinear dynamical systems, bridging the gap between the hard safety
  guarantees of control theory and the convergence guarantees of RL theory. Recent
  advances at the intersection of control and RL follow a two-stage, safety filter
  approach to enforcing hard safety constraints: model-free RL is used to learn a
  potentially unsafe controller, whose actions are projected onto safe sets prescribed,
  for example, by a control barrier function. Though safe, such approaches lose any
  convergence guarantees enjoyed by the underlying RL methods. In this paper, we develop
  a single-stage, sampling-based approach to hard constraint satisfaction that learns
  RL controllers enjoying classical convergence guarantees while satisfying hard safety
  constraints throughout training and deployment. We validate the efficacy of our
  approach in simulation, including safe control of a quadcopter in a challenging
  obstacle avoidance problem, and demonstrate that it outperforms existing benchmarks.'
