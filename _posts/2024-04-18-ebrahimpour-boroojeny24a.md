title: Spectrum Extraction and Clipping for Implicitly Linear Layers
software: https://github.com/Ali-E/FastClip
abstract: We show the effectiveness of automatic differentiation in efficiently and
  correctly computing and controlling the spectrum of implicitly linear operators,
  a rich family of layer types including all standard convolutional and dense layers.
  We provide the first clipping method which is correct for general convolution layers,
  and illuminate the representational limitation that caused correctness issues in
  prior work. We study the effect of the batch normalization layers when concatenated
  with convolutional layers and show how our clipping method can be applied to their
  composition. By comparing the accuracy and performance of our algorithms to the
  state-of-the-art methods, using various experiments, we show they are more precise
  and efficient and lead to better generalization and adversarial robustness. We provide
  the code for using our methods at https://github.com/Ali-E/FastClip.
