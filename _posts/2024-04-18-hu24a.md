title: Pixel-wise Smoothing for Certified Robustness against Camera Motion Perturbations
software: https://github.com/HanjiangHu/pixel-wise-smoothing
abstract: Deep learning-based visual perception models lack robustness when faced
  with camera motion perturbations in practice. The current certification process
  for assessing robustness is costly and time-consuming due to the extensive number
  of image projections required for Monte Carlo sampling in the 3D camera motion space.
  To address these challenges, we present a novel, efficient, and practical framework
  for certifying the robustness of 3D-2D projective transformations against camera
  motion perturbations. Our approach leverages a smoothing distribution over the 2D-pixel
  space instead of in the 3D physical space, eliminating the need for costly camera
  motion sampling and significantly enhancing the efficiency of robustness certifications.
  With the pixel-wise smoothed classifier, we are able to fully upper bound the projection
  errors using a technique of uniform partitioning in camera motion space. Additionally,
  we extend our certification framework to a more general scenario where only a single-frame
  point cloud is required in the projection oracle. Through extensive experimentation,
  we validate the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency enabled by our proposed
  method. Remarkably, our approach achieves approximately 80% certified accuracy while
  utilizing only 30% of the projected image frames.
