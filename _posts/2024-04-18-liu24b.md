title: Efficient Neural Architecture Design via Capturing Architecture-Performance
  Joint Distribution
abstract: The relationship between architecture and performance is critical for improving
  the efficiency of neural architecture design, yet few efforts have been devoted
  to understanding this relationship between architecture and performance, especially
  architecture-performance joint distribution. In this paper, we propose Semi-Supervised
  Generative Adversarial Networks Neural Architecture Design Method or SemiGAN-NAD
  to capture the architecture-performance joint distribution with few performance
  labels. It is composed of Bidirectional Transformer of Architecture and Performance
  (Bi-Arch2Perf) and Neural Architecture Conditional Generation (NACG). Bi-Arch2Perf
  is developed to learn the joint distribution of architecture and performance from
  bidirectional conditional distribution through the adversarial training of the discriminator,
  the architecture generator, and the performance predictor. Then, the incorporation
  of semi-supervised learning optimizes the construction of Bi-Arch2Perf by utilizing
  a large amount of architecture information without performance annotation in search
  space. Based on the learned bidirectional relationship, the performance of architecture
  is predicted by NACG in high-performance architecture space to efficiently discover
  well-promising neural architectures. The experimental results on NAS benchmarks
  demonstrate that SemiGAN-NAD achieves competitive performance with reduced evaluation
  time compared with the latest NAS methods. Moreover, the high-performance architecture
  signatures learned by Bi-Arch2Perf are also illustrated in our experiments.
