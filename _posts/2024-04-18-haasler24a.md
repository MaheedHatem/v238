title: Bures-Wasserstein Means of Graphs
abstract: Finding the mean of sampled data is a fundamental task in machine learning
  and statistics. However, in cases where the data samples are graph objects, defining
  a mean is an inherently difficult task. We propose a novel framework for defining
  a graph mean via embeddings in the space of smooth graph signal distributions, where
  graph similarity can be measured using the Wasserstein metric. By finding a mean
  in this embedding space, we can recover a mean graph that preserves structural information.
  We establish the existence and uniqueness of the novel graph mean, and provide an
  iterative algorithm for computing it. To highlight the potential of our framework
  as a valuable tool for practical applications in machine learning, it is evaluated
  on various tasks, including k-means clustering of structured aligned graphs, classification
  of functional brain networks, and semi-supervised node classification in multi-layer
  graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent
  performance, outperforms existing baseline approaches, and improves the performance
  of state-of-the-art methods.
