  Embedding Model'

abstract: 'Understanding the structure and dynamics of scientific research, i.e.,
  the science of science (SciSci), has become an important area of research in order
  to address imminent questions including how scholars interact to advance science,
  how disciplines are related and evolve, and how research impact can be quantified
  and predicted. Central to the study of SciSci has been the analysis of citation
  networks. Here, two prominent modeling methodologies have been employed: one is
  to assess the citation impact dynamics of papers using parametric distributions,
  and the other is to embed the citation networks in a latent space optimal for characterizing
  the static relations between papers in terms of their citations. Interestingly,
  citation networks are a prominent example of single-event dynamic networks, i.e.,
  networks for which each dyad only has a single event (i.e., the point in time of
  citation). We presently propose a novel likelihood function for the characterization
  of such single-event networks. Using this likelihood, we propose the Dynamic Impact
  Single-Event Embedding model (DISEE). The DISEE model characterizes the scientific
  interactions in terms of a latent distance model in which random effects account
  for citation heterogeneity while the time-varying impact is characterized using
  existing parametric representations for assessment of dynamic impact. We highlight
  the proposed approach on several real citation networks finding that DISEE well
  reconciles static latent distance network embedding approaches with classical dynamic
  impact assessments.'
