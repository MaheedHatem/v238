title: 'GRAWA: Gradient-based Weighted Averaging for Distributed Training of Deep
  Learning Models'
software: https://github.com/tolgadimli/GRAWA
abstract: We study distributed training of deep learning models in time-constrained
  environments. We propose a new algorithm that periodically pulls workers towards
  the center variable computed as a weighted average of workers, where the weights
  are inversely proportional to the gradient norms of the workers such that recovering
  the flat regions in the optimization landscape is prioritized. We develop two asynchronous
  variants of the proposed algorithm that we call Model-level and Layer-level Gradient-based
  Weighted Averaging (resp. MGRAWA and LGRAWA), which differ in terms of the weighting
  scheme that is either done with respect to the entire model or is applied layer-wise.
  On the theoretical front, we prove the convergence guarantee for the proposed approach
  in both convex and non-convex settings. We then experimentally demonstrate that
  our algorithms outperform the competitor methods by achieving faster convergence
  and recovering better quality and flatter local optima. We also carry out an ablation
  study to analyze the scalability of the proposed algorithms in more crowded distributed
  training environments. Finally, we report that our approach requires less frequent
  communication and fewer distributed updates compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.
