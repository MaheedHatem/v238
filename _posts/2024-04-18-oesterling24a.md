title: 'Fair Machine Unlearning: Data Removal while Mitigating Disparities'
software: https://github.com/AI4LIFE-GROUP/fair-unlearning
abstract: The Right to be Forgotten is a core principle outlined by regulatory frameworks
  such as the EUâ€™s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This principle allows
  individuals to request that their personal data be deleted from deployed machine
  learning models. While "forgetting" can be naively achieved by retraining on the
  remaining dataset, it is computationally expensive to do to so with each new request.
  As such, several machine unlearning methods have been proposed as efficient alternatives
  to retraining. These methods aim to approximate the predictive performance of retraining,
  but fail to consider how unlearning impacts other properties critical to real-world
  applications such as fairness. In this work, we demonstrate that most efficient
  unlearning methods cannot accommodate popular fairness interventions, and we propose
  the first fair machine unlearning method that can efficiently unlearn data instances
  from a fair objective. We derive theoretical results which demonstrate that our
  method can provably unlearn data and provably maintain fairness performance. Extensive
  experimentation with real-world datasets highlight the efficacy of our method at
  unlearning data instances while preserving fairness. Code is provided at https://github.com/AI4LIFE-GROUP/fair-unlearning.
