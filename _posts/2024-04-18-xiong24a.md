title: A/B Testing and Best-arm Identification for Linear Bandits with Robustness
  to Non-stationarity
software: https://github.com/FFTypeZero/bobw_linear
abstract: 'We investigate the fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI) problem for
  linear bandits in a potentially non-stationary environment. Given a finite arm set
  $\mathcal{X}\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, a fixed budget $T$, and an unpredictable sequence
  of parameters $\left\lbrace\theta_t\right\rbrace_{t=1}^{T}$, an algorithm will aim
  to correctly identify the best arm $x^* := \arg\max_{x\in\mathcal{X}}x^\top\sum_{t=1}^{T}\theta_t$
  with probability as high as possible. Prior work has addressed the stationary setting
  where $\theta_t = \theta_1$ for all $t$ and demonstrated that the error probability
  decreases as $\exp(-T /\rho^*)$ for a problem-dependent constant $\rho^*$. But in
  many real-world $A/B/n$ multivariate testing scenarios that motivate our work, the
  environment is non-stationary and an algorithm expecting a stationary setting can
  easily fail. For robust identification, it is well-known that if arms are chosen
  randomly and non-adaptively from a G-optimal design over $\mathcal{X}$ at each time
  then the error probability decreases as $\exp(-T\Delta^2_{(1)}/d)$, where $\Delta_{(1)}
  = \min_{x \neq x^*} (x^* - x)^\top \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^T \theta_t$. As there exist
  environments where $\Delta_{(1)}^2/ d \ll 1/ \rho^*$, we are motivated to propose
  a novel algorithm P1-RAGE that aims to obtain the best of both worlds: robustness
  to non-stationarity and fast rates of identification in benign settings. We characterize
  the error probability of P1-RAGE and demonstrate empirically that the algorithm
  indeed never performs worse than G-optimal design but compares favorably to the
  best algorithms in the stationary setting.'
