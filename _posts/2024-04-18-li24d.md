title: 'TenGAN: Pure Transformer Encoders Make an Efficient Discrete GAN for De Novo
  Molecular Generation'
software: https://github.com/naruto7283/TenGAN
abstract: Deep generative models for de novo molecular generation using discrete data,
  such as the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings, have
  attracted widespread attention in drug design. However, training instability often
  plagues generative adversarial networks (GANs), leading to problems such as mode
  collapse and low diversity. This study proposes a pure transformer encoder-based
  GAN (TenGAN) to solve these issues. The generator and discriminator of TenGAN are
  variants of the transformer encoders and are combined with reinforcement learning
  (RL) to generate molecules with the desired chemical properties. Besides, data augmentation
  of the variant SMILES is leveraged for the TenGAN training to learn the semantics
  and syntax of SMILES strings. Additionally, we introduce an enhanced variant of
  TenGAN, named Ten(W)GAN, which incorporates mini-batch discrimination and Wasserstein
  GAN to improve the ability to generate molecules. The experimental results and ablation
  studies on the QM9 and ZINC datasets showed that the proposed models generated highly
  valid and novel molecules with the desired chemical properties in a computationally
  efficient manner.
