title: Consistent Hierarchical Classification with A Generalized Metric
abstract: 'In multi-class hierarchical classification, a natural evaluation metric
  is the tree distance loss that takes the value of two labels’ distance on the pre-defined
  tree hierarchy. This metric is motivated by that its Bayes optimal solution is the
  deepest label on the tree whose induced superclass (subtree rooted at it) includes
  the true label with probability at least $\frac{1}{2}$. However, it can hardly handle
  the risk sensitivity of different tasks since its accuracy requirement for induced
  superclasses is fixed at $\frac{1}{2}$. In this paper, we first introduce a new
  evaluation metric that generalizes the tree distance loss, whose solution’s accuracy
  constraint $\frac{1+c}{2}$ can be controlled by a penalty value $c$ tailored for
  different tasks: a higher c indicates the emphasis on prediction’s accuracy and
  a lower one indicates that on specificity. Then, we propose a novel class of consistent
  surrogate losses based on an intuitive presentation of our generalized metric and
  its regret, which can be compatible with various binary losses. Finally, we theoretically
  derive the regret transfer bounds for our proposed surrogates and empirically validate
  their usefulness on benchmark datasets.'
