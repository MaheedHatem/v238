title: Generating and Imputing Tabular Data via Diffusion and Flow-based Gradient-Boosted
  Trees
software: https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/ForestDiffusion
abstract: Tabular data is hard to acquire and is subject to missing values. This paper
  introduces a novel approach for generating and imputing mixed-type (continuous and
  categorical) tabular data utilizing score-based diffusion and conditional flow matching.
  In contrast to prior methods that rely on neural networks to learn the score function
  or the vector field, we adopt XGBoost, a widely used Gradient-Boosted Tree (GBT)
  technique. To test our method, we build one of the most extensive benchmarks for
  tabular data generation and imputation, containing 27 diverse datasets and 9 metrics.
  Through empirical evaluation across the benchmark, we demonstrate that our approach
  outperforms deep-learning generation methods in data generation tasks and remains
  competitive in data imputation. Notably, it can be trained in parallel using CPUs
  without requiring a GPU. Our Python and R code is available at \url{https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/ForestDiffusion}.
