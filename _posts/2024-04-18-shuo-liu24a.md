title: Unified Transfer Learning in High-Dimensional Linear Regression
abstract: 'Transfer learning plays a key role in modern data analysis when: (1) the
  target data are scarce but the source data are sufficient; (2) the distributions
  of the source and target data are heterogeneous. This paper develops an interpretable
  unified transfer learning model, termed as UTrans, which can detect both transferable
  variables and source data. More specifically, we establish the estimation error
  bounds and prove that our bounds are lower than those with target data only. Besides,
  we propose a source detection algorithm based on hypothesis testing to exclude the
  nontransferable data. We evaluate and compare UTrans to the existing algorithms
  in multiple experiments. It is shown that UTrans attains much lower estimation and
  prediction errors than the existing methods, while preserving interpretability.
  We finally apply it to the US intergenerational mobility data and compare our proposed
  algorithms to the classical machine learning algorithms.'
