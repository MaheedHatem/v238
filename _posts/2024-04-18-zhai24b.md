title: Deep Learning-Based Alternative Route Computation
abstract: Algorithms for the computation of alternative routes in road networks power
  many geographic navigation systems. A good set of alternative routes offers meaningful
  options to the user of the system and can support applications such as routing that
  is robust to failures (e.g., road closures, extreme traffic congestion, etc.) and
  routing with diverse preferences and objective functions. Algorithmic techniques
  for alternative route computation include the penalty method, via-node type algorithms
  (which deploy bidirectional search and finding plateaus), and, more recently, electrical-circuit
  based algorithms. In this work we focus on the practically important family of via-node
  type algorithms and aim to produce high quality alternative routes for road networks
  using a novel deep learning-based approach that learns a representation of the underlying
  road network. We show that this approach can support natural objectives, such as
  the uniformly bounded stretch, that are difficult and computationally expensive
  to support through traditional algorithmic techniques. Moreover, we achieve this
  in a practical system based on the Customizable Route Planning (CRP) hierarchical
  routing architecture. Our training methodology uses the hierarchical partition of
  the graph and trains a model to predict which boundary nodes in the partition should
  be crossed by the alternative routes. We describe our methods in detail and evaluate
  them against previously studied baselines, showing quality improvements in the road
  networks of Seattle, Paris, and Bangalore.
