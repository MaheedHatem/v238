title: " Variational Resampling "
software: " https://github.com/okviman/Variational-Resampling "
abstract: " We cast the resampling step in particle filters (PFs) as a variational
  inference problem, resulting in a new class of resampling schemes: variational resampling.
  Variational resampling is flexible as it allows for choices of 1) divergence to
  minimize, 2) target distribution to input to the divergence, and 3) divergence minimization
  algorithm. With this novel application of VI to particle filters, variational resampling
  further unifies these two powerful and popular methodologies. We construct two variational
  resamplers that replicate particles in order to maximize lower bounds with respect
  to two different target measures. We benchmark our variational resamplers on challenging
  smoothing tasks, outperforming PFs that implement the state-of-the-art resampling
  schemes. "
