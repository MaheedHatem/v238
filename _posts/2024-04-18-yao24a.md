abstract: Motivated by the computation of the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator
  (NPMLE) and the Bayesian posterior in statistics, this paper explores the problem
  of convex optimization over the space of all probability distributions. We introduce
  an implicit scheme, called the implicit KL proximal descent (IKLPD) algorithm, for
  discretizing a continuous-time gradient flow relative to the Kullbackâ€“Leibler (KL)
  divergence for minimizing a convex target functional. We show that IKLPD converges
  to a global optimum at a polynomial rate from any initialization; moreover, if the
  objective functional is strongly convex relative to the KL divergence, for example,
  when the target functional itself is a KL divergence as in the context of Bayesian
  posterior computation, IKLPD exhibits globally exponential convergence. Computationally,
  we propose a numerical method based on normalizing flow to realize IKLPD. Conversely,
  our numerical method can also be viewed as a new approach that sequentially trains
  a normalizing flow for minimizing a convex functional with a strong theoretical
  guarantee.
