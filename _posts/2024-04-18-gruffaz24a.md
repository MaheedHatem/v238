title: Stochastic Approximation with Biased MCMC for Expectation Maximization
software: https://github.com/Red-Portal/MCMCSAEM.jl
abstract: The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a widespread method for empirical
  Bayesian inference, but its expectation step (E-step) is often intractable. Employing
  a stochastic approximation scheme with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) can circumvent
  this issue, resulting in an algorithm known as MCMC-SAEM. While theoretical guarantees
  for MCMC-SAEM have previously been established, these results are restricted to
  the case where asymptotically unbiased MCMC algorithms are used. In practice, MCMC-SAEM
  is often run with asymptotically biased MCMC, for which the consequences are theoretically
  less understood. In this work, we fill this gap by analyzing the asymptotics and
  non-asymptotics of SAEM with biased MCMC steps, particularly the effect of bias.
  We also provide numerical experiments comparing the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin
  algorithm (MALA), which is asymptotically unbiased, and the unadjusted Langevin
  algorithm (ULA), which is asymptotically biased, on synthetic and real datasets.
  Experimental results show that ULA is more stable with respect to the choice of
  Langevin stepsize and can sometimes result in faster convergence.
