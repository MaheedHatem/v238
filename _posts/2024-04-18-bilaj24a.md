title: Meta Learning in Bandits within shared affine Subspaces
software: https://github.com/AIPhD/Projected_Bandits
abstract: 'We study the problem of meta-learning several contextual stochastic bandits
  tasks by leveraging their concentration around a low dimensional affine subspace,
  which we learn via online principal component analysis to reduce the expected regret
  over the encountered bandits. We propose and theoretically analyze two strategies
  that solve the problem: One based on the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty
  and the other via Thompson sampling. Our framework is generic and includes previously
  proposed approaches as special cases. Besides, the empirical results show that our
  methods significantly reduce the regret on several bandit tasks.'
