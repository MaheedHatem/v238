title: Learning-Based Algorithms for Graph Searching Problems
software: https://github.com/ADePavia/graph_searching
abstract: We consider the problem of graph searching with prediction recently introduced
  by Banerjee et al. (2023). In this problem, an agent starting at some vertex r has
  to traverse a (potentially unknown) graph G to find a hidden goal node g while minimizing
  the total distance traveled. We study a setting in which at any node v, the agent
  receives a noisy estimate of the distance from v to g. We design algorithms for
  this search task on unknown graphs. We establish the first formal guarantees on
  unknown weighted graphs and provide lower bounds showing that the algorithms we
  propose have optimal or nearly-optimal dependence on the prediction error. Further,
  we perform numerical experiments demonstrating that in addition to being robust
  to adversarial error, our algorithms perform well in typical instances in which
  the error is stochastic. Finally, we provide simpler performance bounds on the algorithms
  of Banerjee et al. (2023) for the case of searching on a known graph and establish
  new lower bounds for this setting.
