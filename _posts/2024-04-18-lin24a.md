title: A Specialized Semismooth Newton Method for Kernel-Based Optimal Transport
software: https://github.com/tyDLin/OTSSN
abstract: 'Kernel-based optimal transport (OT) estimators offer an alternative, functional
  estimation procedure to address OT problems from samples. Recent works suggest that
  these estimators are more statistically efficient than plug-in (linear programming-based)
  OT estimators when comparing probability measures in high-dimensions (Vacher et
  al., 2021). Unfortunately,that statistical benefit comes at a very steep computational
  price: because their computation relies on the short-step interior-point method
  (SSIPM), which comes with a large iteration count in practice, these estimators
  quickly become intractable w.r.t. sample size $n$. To scale these estimators to
  larger $n$, we propose a nonsmooth fixedpoint model for the kernel-based OT problem,
  and show that it can be efficiently solved via a specialized semismooth Newton (SSN)
  method: We show, exploring the problemâ€™s structure, that the per-iteration cost
  of performing one SSN step can be significantly reduced in practice. We prove that
  our SSN method achieves a global convergence rate of $O(1/\sqrt{k})$, and a local
  quadratic convergence rate under standard regularity conditions. We show substantial
  speedups over SSIPM on both synthetic and real datasets.'
