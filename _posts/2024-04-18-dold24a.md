title: Bayesian Semi-structured Subspace Inference
software: https://github.com/doldd/Bayesian_Semi_Sub
abstract: Semi-structured regression models enable the joint modeling of interpretable
  structured and complex unstructured feature effects. The structured model part is
  inspired by statistical models and can be used to infer the input-output relationship
  for features of particular importance. The complex unstructured part defines an
  arbitrary deep neural network and thereby provides enough flexibility to achieve
  competitive prediction performance. While these models can also account for aleatoric
  uncertainty, there is still a lack of work on accounting for epistemic uncertainty.
  In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a Bayesian approximation for
  semi-structured regression models using subspace inference. To this end, we extend
  subspace inference for joint posterior sampling from a full parameter space for
  structured effects and a subspace for unstructured effects. Apart from this hybrid
  sampling scheme, our method allows for tunable complexity of the subspace and can
  capture multiple minima in the loss landscape. Numerical experiments validate our
  approach’s efficacy in recovering structured effect parameter posteriors in semi-structured
  models and approaching the full-space posterior distribution of MCMC for increasing
  subspace dimension. Further, our approach exhibits competitive predictive performance
  across simulated and real-world datasets.
