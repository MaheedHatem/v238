title: Online Distribution Learning with Local Privacy Constraints
abstract: We study the problem of online conditional distribution estimation with
  \emph{unbounded} label sets under local differential privacy. The problem may be
  succinctly stated as follows. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a distribution-valued function
  class with an unbounded label set. Our aim is to estimate an \emph{unknown} function
  $f\in \mathcal{F}$ in an online fashion. More precisely, at time $t$, given a sample
  ${\mathbf{x}}_t$, we generate an estimate of $f({\mathbf{x}}_t)$ using only a \emph{privatized}
  version of the true \emph{labels} sampled from $f({\mathbf{x}}_t)$. The objective
  is to minimize the cumulative KL-risk of a finite horizon $T$. We show that under
  $(\epsilon,0)$-local differential privacy for the labels, the KL-risk equals $\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\sqrt{KT}),$
  up to poly-logarithmic factors, where $K=|\mathcal{F}|$. This result significantly
  differs from the $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T\log K})$ bound derived in Wu et al., (2023a)
  for \emph{bounded} label sets. As a side-result, our approach recovers a nearly
  tight upper bound for the hypothesis selection problem of Gopi et al., (2020), which
  has only been established for the \emph{batch} setting.
