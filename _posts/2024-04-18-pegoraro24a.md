title: Vector Quantile Regression on Manifolds
software: https://github.com/Marco-Peg/mvqr
abstract: Quantile regression (QR) is a statistical tool for distribution-free estimation
  of conditional quantiles of a target variable given explanatory features. QR is
  limited by the assumption that the target distribution is univariate and defined
  on an Euclidean domain. Although the notion of quantiles was recently extended to
  multi-variate distributions, QR for multi-variate distributions on manifolds remains
  underexplored, even though many important applications inherently involve data distributed
  on, e.g., spheres (climate and geological phenomena), and tori (dihedral angles
  in proteins). By leveraging optimal transport theory and c-concave functions, we
  meaningfully define conditional vector quantile functions of high-dimensional variables
  on manifolds (M-CVQFs). Our approach allows for quantile estimation, regression,
  and computation of conditional confidence sets and likelihoods. We demonstrate the
  approachâ€™s efficacy and provide insights regarding the meaning of non-Euclidean
  quantiles through synthetic and real data experiments.
