title: Estimation of partially known Gaussian graphical models with score-based structural
  priors
software: https://github.com/Tenceto/langevin_ggm
abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for the support estimation of partially known
  Gaussian graphical models that incorporates prior information about the underlying
  graph. In contrast to classical approaches that provide a point estimate based on
  a maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori approach using (simple) priors on the
  precision matrix, we consider a prior on the graph and rely on annealed Langevin
  diffusion to generate samples from the posterior distribution. Since the Langevin
  sampler requires access to the score function of the underlying graph prior, we
  use graph neural networks to effectively estimate the score from a graph dataset
  (either available beforehand or generated from a known distribution). Numerical
  experiments in different setups demonstrate the benefits of our approach.
