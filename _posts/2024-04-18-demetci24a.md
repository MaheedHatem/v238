title: Breaking isometric ties and introducing priors in Gromov-Wasserstein distances
software: https://github.com/pinardemetci/AGW-AISTATS24
abstract: Gromov-Wasserstein distance has many applications in machine learning due
  to its ability to compare measures across metric spaces and its invariance to isometric
  transformations. However, in certain applications, this invariant property can be
  too flexible, thus undesirable. Moreover, the Gromov-Wasserstein distance solely
  considers pairwise sample similarities in input datasets, disregarding the raw feature
  representations. We propose a new optimal transport formulation, called Augmented
  Gromov-Wasserstein (AGW), that allows for some control over the level of rigidity
  to transformations. It also incorporates feature alignments, enabling us to better
  leverage prior knowledge on the input data for improved performance. We first present
  theoretical insights into the proposed method. We then demonstrate its usefulness
  for single-cell multi-omic alignment tasks and heterogeneous domain adaptation in
  machine learning.
