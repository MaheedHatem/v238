title: Consistency of Dictionary-Based Manifold Learning
software: https://github.com/sjkoelle/montlake
abstract: We analyze a paradigm for interpretable Manifold Learning for scientific
  data analysis, whereby one parametrizes a manifold with d smooth functions from
  a scientist-provided dictionary of meaningful, domain-related functions. When such
  a parametrization exists, we provide an algorithm for finding it based on sparse
  regression in the manifold tangent bundle, bypassing more standard, agnostic manifold
  learning algorithms. We prove conditions for the existence of such parameterizations
  in function space and the first end to end recovery results from finite samples.
  The method is demonstrated on both synthetic problems and with data from a real
  scientific domain.
