title: The AL$\ell_0$CORE Tensor Decomposition for Sparse Count Data
software: https://github.com/jhood3/allocore
abstract: This paper introduces AL$\ell_0$CORE, a new form of probabilistic non-negative
  tensor decomposition. AL$\ell_0$CORE is a Tucker decomposition that constrains the
  number of non-zero elements (i.e., the $\ell_0$-norm) of the core tensor to be at
  most $Q$. While the user dictates the total budget $Q$, the locations and values
  of the non-zero elements are latent variables allocated across the core tensor during
  inference. AL$\ell_0$CORE—i.e., allocated $\ell_0$-constrained core—thus enjoys
  both the computational tractability of canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition and
  the qualitatively appealing latent structure of Tucker. In a suite of real-data
  experiments, we demonstrate that AL$\ell_0$CORE typically requires only tiny fractions
  (e.g., 1%) of the core to achieve the same results as Tucker at a correspondingly
  small fraction of the cost.
