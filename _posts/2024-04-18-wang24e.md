title: Efficient Data Shapley for Weighted Nearest Neighbor Algorithms
abstract: This work aims to address an open problem in data valuation literature concerning
  the efficient computation of Data Shapley for weighted $K$ nearest neighbor algorithm
  (WKNN-Shapley). By considering the accuracy of hard-label KNN with discretized weights
  as the utility function, we reframe the computation of WKNN-Shapley into a counting
  problem and introduce a quadratic-time algorithm, presenting a notable improvement
  from $O(N^K)$, the best result from existing literature. We develop a deterministic
  approximation algorithm that further improves computational efficiency while maintaining
  the key fairness properties of the Shapley value. Through extensive experiments,
  we demonstrate WKNN-Shapleyâ€™s computational efficiency and its superior performance
  in discerning data quality compared to its unweighted counterpart.
