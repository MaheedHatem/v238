title: Revisiting the Noise Model of Stochastic Gradient Descent
abstract: The effectiveness of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in neural network
  optimization is significantly influenced by stochastic gradient noise (SGN). Following
  the central limit theorem, SGN was initially described as Gaussian, but recently
  Simsekli et al (2019) demonstrated that the $S\alpha S$ Lévy distribution provides
  a better fit for the SGN. This assertion was purportedly debunked and rebounded
  to the Gaussian noise model that had been previously proposed. This study provides
  robust, comprehensive empirical evidence that SGN is heavy-tailed and is better
  represented by the $S\alpha S$ distribution. Our experiments include several datasets
  and multiple models, both discriminative and generative. Furthermore, we argue that
  different network parameters preserve distinct SGN properties. We develop a novel
  framework based on a Lévy-driven stochastic differential equation (SDE), where one-dimensional
  Lévy processes describe each parameter. This leads to a more accurate characterization
  of the dynamics of SGD around local minima. We use our framework to study SGD properties
  near local minima; these include the mean escape time and preferable exit directions.
