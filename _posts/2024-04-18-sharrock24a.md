title: Tuning-Free Maximum Likelihood Training of Latent Variable Models via Coin
  Betting
software: https://github.com/chris-nemeth/coinem
abstract: 'We introduce two new particle-based algorithms for learning latent variable
  models via marginal maximum likelihood estimation, including one which is entirely
  tuning-free. Our methods are based on the perspective of marginal maximum likelihood
  estimation as an optimization problem: namely, as the minimization of a free energy
  functional. One way to solve this problem is via the discretization of a gradient
  flow associated with the free energy. We study one such approach, which resembles
  an extension of Stein variational gradient descent, establishing a descent lemma
  which guarantees that the free energy decreases at each iteration. This method,
  and any other obtained as the discretization of the gradient flow, necessarily depends
  on a learning rate which must be carefully tuned by the practitioner in order to
  ensure convergence at a suitable rate. With this in mind, we also propose another
  algorithm for optimizing the free energy which is entirely learning rate free, based
  on coin betting techniques from convex optimization. We validate the performance
  of our algorithms across several numerical experiments, including several high-dimensional
  settings. Our results are competitive with existing particle-based methods, without
  the need for any hyperparameter tuning.'
