title: Mixed Models with Multiple Instance Learning
software: https://github.com/AIH-SGML/MixMIL
abstract: Predicting patient features from single-cell data can help identify cellular
  states implicated in health and disease. Linear models and average cell type expressions
  are typically favored for this task for their efficiency and robustness, but they
  overlook the rich cell heterogeneity inherent in single-cell data. To address this
  gap, we introduce MixMIL, a framework integrating Generalized Linear Mixed Models
  (GLMM) and Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), upholding the advantages of linear
  models while modeling cell state heterogeneity. By leveraging predefined cell embeddings,
  MixMIL enhances computational efficiency and aligns with recent advancements in
  single-cell representation learning. Our empirical results reveal that MixMIL outperforms
  existing MIL models in single-cell datasets, uncovering new associations and elucidating
  biological mechanisms across different domains.
