title: Multi-Resolution Active Learning of Fourier Neural Operators
software: https://github.com/shib0li/MRA-FNO
abstract: Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) is a popular operator learning framework.
  It not only achieves the state-of-the-art performance in many tasks, but also is
  efficient in training and prediction. However, collecting training data for the
  FNO can be a costly bottleneck in practice, because it often demands expensive physical
  simulations. To overcome this problem, we propose Multi-Resolution Active Learning
  of FNO (MRA-FNO), which can dynamically select the input functions and resolutions
  to lower the data cost as much as possible while optimizing the learning efficiency.
  Specifically, we propose a probabilistic multi-resolution FNO and use ensemble Monte-Carlo
  to develop an effective posterior inference algorithm. To conduct active learning,
  we maximize a utility-cost ratio as the acquisition function to acquire new examples
  and resolutions at each step. We use moment matching and the matrix determinant
  lemma to enable tractable, efficient utility computation. Furthermore, we develop
  a cost annealing framework to avoid over-penalizing high-resolution queries at the
  early stage. The over-penalization is severe when the cost difference is significant
  between the resolutions, which renders active learning often stuck at low-resolution
  queries and inferior performance. Our method overcomes this problem and applies
  to general multi-fidelity active learning and optimization problems. We have shown
  the advantage of our method in several benchmark operator learning tasks. The code
  is available at https://github.com/shib0li/MRA-FNO.
