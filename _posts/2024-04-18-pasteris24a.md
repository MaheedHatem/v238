title: Sum-max Submodular Bandits
software: https://github.com/albertorumi/mse3
abstract: Many online decision-making problems correspond to maximizing a sequence
  of submodular functions. In this work, we introduce sum-max functions, a subclass
  of monotone submodular functions capturing several interesting problems, including
  best-of-$K$-bandits, combinatorial bandits, and the bandit versions on $M$-medians
  and hitting sets. We show that all functions in this class satisfy a key property
  that we call pseudo-concavity. This allows us to prove $\big(1 - \frac{1}{e}\big)$-regret
  bounds for bandit feedback in the nonstochastic setting of the order of $\sqrt{MKT}$
  (ignoring log factors), where $T$ is the time horizon and $M$ is a cardinality constraint.
  This bound, attained by a simple and efficient algorithm, significantly improves
  on the $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(T^{2/3}\big)$ regret bound for online monotone
  submodular maximization with bandit feedback. We also extend our results to a bandit
  version of the facility location problem.
