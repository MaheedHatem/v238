title: Trigonometric Quadrature Fourier Features for Scalable Gaussian Process Regression
software: https://github.com/kevinli1324/TQFF
abstract: Fourier feature approximations have been successfully applied in the literature
  for scalable Gaussian Process (GP) regression. In particular, Quadrature Fourier
  Features (QFF) derived from Gaussian quadrature rules have gained popularity in
  recent years due to their improved approximation accuracy and better calibrated
  uncertainty estimates compared to Random Fourier Feature (RFF) methods. However,
  a key limitation of QFF is that its performance can suffer from well-known pathologies
  related to highly oscillatory quadrature, resulting in mediocre approximation with
  limited features. We address this critical issue via a new Trigonometric Quadrature
  Fourier Feature (TQFF) method, which uses a novel non-Gaussian quadrature rule specifically
  tailored for the desired Fourier transform. We derive an exact quadrature rule for
  TQFF, along with kernel approximation error bounds for the resulting feature map.
  We then demonstrate the improved performance of our method over RFF and Gaussian
  QFF in a suite of numerical experiments and applications, and show the TQFF enjoys
  accurate GP approximations over a broad range of length-scales using fewer features.
