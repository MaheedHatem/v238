  Density Estimators'
software: https://github.com/falkaer/lakde
abstract: Kernel density estimation (KDE) is a powerful technique for non-parametric
  density estimation, yet practical use of KDE-based methods remains limited by insufficient
  representational flexibility, especially for higher-dimensional data. Contrary to
  KDE, K-nearest neighbor (KNN) density estimation procedures locally adapt the density
  based on the K-nearest neighborhood, but unfortunately only provide asymptotically
  correct density estimates. We present the KNN-KDE method introducing observation-specific
  kernels for KDE that are locally adapted through priors defined by the covariance
  of the K-nearest neighborhood, forming a fully Bayesian model with exact density
  estimates. We further derive a scalable inference procedure that infers parameters
  through variational inference by optimizing the predictive likelihood exploiting
  sparsity, batched optimization, and parallel computation for massive inference speedups.
  We find that KNN-KDE provides valid density estimates superior to conventional KDE
  and KNN density estimation on both synthetic and real data sets. We further observe
  that the bayesian KNN-KDE even outperforms recent neural density estimation procedures
  on two of the five considered real data sets. The KNN-KDE unifies conventional kernel
  and KNN density estimation providing a scalable, generic and accurate framework
  for density estimation.
