title: 'Implicit Regularization in Deep Tucker Factorization: Low-Rankness via Structured
  Sparsity'
software: https://github.com/Stef-hub/deeptuckerimplicit
abstract: We theoretically analyze the implicit regularization of deep learning for
  tensor completion. We show that deep Tucker factorization trained by gradient descent
  induces a structured sparse regularization. This leads to a characterization of
  the effect of the depth of the neural network on the implicit regularization and
  provides a potential explanation for the bias of gradient descent towards solutions
  with low multilinear rank. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings
  and give insights into the behavior of gradient descent in deep tensor factorization.
