title: Improved Regret Bounds of (Multinomial) Logistic Bandits via Regret-to-Confidence-Set
  Conversion
software: https://github.com/nick-jhlee/logistic_bandit
abstract: Logistic bandit is a ubiquitous framework of modeling usersâ€™ choices, e.g.,
  click vs. no click for advertisement recommender system. We observe that the prior
  works overlook or neglect dependencies in $S \geq \Vert \theta_\star \Vert_2$, where
  $\theta_\star \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is the unknown parameter vector, which is particularly
  problematic when $S$ is large, e.g., $S \geq d$. In this work, we improve the dependency
  on $S$ via a novel approach called {\it regret-to-confidence set conversion (R2CS)},
  which allows us to construct a convex confidence set based on only the \textit{existence}
  of an online learning algorithm with a regret guarantee. Using R2CS, we obtain a
  strict improvement in the regret bound w.r.t. $S$ in logistic bandits while retaining
  computational feasibility and the dependence on other factors such as $d$ and $T$.
  We apply our new confidence set to the regret analyses of logistic bandits with
  a new martingale concentration step that circumvents an additional factor of $S$.
  We then extend this analysis to multinomial logistic bandits and obtain similar
  improvements in the regret, showing the efficacy of R2CS. While we applied R2CS
  to the (multinomial) logistic model, R2CS is a generic approach for developing confidence
  sets that can be used for various models, which can be of independent interest.
