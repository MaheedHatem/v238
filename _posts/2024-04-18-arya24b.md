  Graphical Models
software: https://github.com/Shivvrat/SS-CMPE
abstract: We propose a self-supervised learning approach for solving the following
  constrained optimization task in log-linear models or Markov networks. Let $f$ and
  $g$ be two log-linear models defined over the sets $X$ and $Y$ of random variables.
  Given an assignment $x$ to all variables in $X$ (evidence or observations) and a
  real number $q$, the constrained most-probable explanation (CMPE) task seeks to
  find an assignment $y$ to all variables in $Y$ such that $f(x, y)$ is maximized
  and $g(x, y) \leq q$. In our proposed self-supervised approach, given assignments
  $x$ to $X$ (data), we train a deep neural network that learns to output near-optimal
  solutions to the CMPE problem without requiring access to any pre-computed solutions.
  The key idea in our approach is to use first principles and approximate inference
  methods for CMPE to derive novel loss functions that seek to push infeasible solutions
  towards feasible ones and feasible solutions towards optimal ones. We analyze the
  properties of our proposed method and experimentally demonstrate its efficacy on
  several benchmark problems.
