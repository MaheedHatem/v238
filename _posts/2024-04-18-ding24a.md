title: Resilient Constrained Reinforcement Learning
software: https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/Resilient-Constrained-Reinforcement-Learning
abstract: We study a class of constrained reinforcement learning (RL) problems in
  which multiple constraint specifications are not identified before training. It
  is challenging to identify appropriate constraint specifications due to the undefined
  trade-off between the reward maximization objective and the constraint satisfaction,
  which is ubiquitous in constrained decision-making. To tackle this issue, we propose
  a new constrained RL approach that searches for policy and constraint specifications
  together. This method features the adaptation of relaxing the constraint according
  to a relaxation cost introduced in the learning objective. Since this feature mimics
  how ecological systems adapt to disruptions by altering operation, our approach
  is termed as resilient constrained RL. Specifically, we provide a set of sufficient
  conditions that balance the constraint satisfaction and the reward maximization
  in notion of resilient equilibrium, propose a tractable formulation of resilient
  constrained policy optimization that takes this equilibrium as an optimal solution,
  and advocate two resilient constrained policy search algorithms with non-asymptotic
  convergence guarantees on the optimality gap and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate the merits and the effectiveness of our approach in computational
  experiments.
