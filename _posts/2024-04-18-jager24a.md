title: From Data Imputation to Data Cleaning — Automated Cleaning of Tabular Data
  Improves Downstream Predictive Performance
software: https://github.com/se-jaeger/conformal-data-cleaning
abstract: 'The translation of Machine Learning (ML) research innovations to real-world
  applications and the maintenance of ML components are hindered by reoccurring challenges,
  such as reaching high predictive performance, robustness, complying with regulatory
  constraints, or meeting ethical standards. Many of these challenges are related
  to data quality and, in particular, to the lack of automation in data pipelines
  upstream of ML components. Automated data cleaning remains challenging since many
  approaches neglect the dependency structure of the data errors and require task-specific
  heuristics or human input for calibration. In this study, we develop and evaluate
  an application-agnostic ML-based data cleaning approach using well-established imputation
  techniques for automated detection and cleaning of erroneous values. To improve
  the degree of automation, we combine imputation techniques with conformal prediction
  (CP), a model-agnostic and distribution-free method to quantify and calibrate the
  uncertainty of ML models. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Conformal
  Data Cleaning (CDC) improves predictive performance in downstream ML tasks in the
  majority of cases. Our code is available on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/se-jaeger/conformal-data-cleaning}.'
