title: 'Learning to Defer to a Population: A Meta-Learning Approach'
software: https://github.com/dvtailor/meta-l2d
abstract: The learning to defer (L2D) framework allows autonomous systems to be safe
  and robust by allocating difficult decisions to a human expert. All existing work
  on L2D assumes that each expert is well-identified, and if any expert were to change,
  the system should be re-trained. In this work, we alleviate this constraint, formulating
  an L2D system that can cope with never-before-seen experts at test-time. We accomplish
  this by using meta-learning, considering both optimization- and model-based variants.
  Given a small context set to characterize the currently available expert, our framework
  can quickly adapt its deferral policy. For the model-based approach, we employ an
  attention mechanism that is able to look for points in the context set that are
  similar to a given test point, leading to an even more precise assessment of the
  expertâ€™s abilities. In the experiments, we validate our methods on image recognition,
  traffic sign detection, and skin lesion diagnosis benchmarks.
