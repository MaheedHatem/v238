title: Confident Feature Ranking
software: https://github.com/BityaNeuhof/confident_feature_ranking
abstract: Machine learning models are widely applied in various fields. Stakeholders
  often use post-hoc feature importance methods to better understand the input features’
  contribution to the models’ predictions. The interpretation of the importance values
  provided by these methods is frequently based on the relative order of the features
  (their ranking) rather than the importance values themselves. Since the order may
  be unstable, we present a framework for quantifying the uncertainty in global importance
  values. We propose a novel method for the post-hoc interpretation of feature importance
  values that is based on the framework and pairwise comparisons of the feature importance
  values. This method produces simultaneous confidence intervals for the features’
  ranks, which include the “true” (infinite sample) ranks with high probability, and
  enables the selection of the set of top-k important features.
