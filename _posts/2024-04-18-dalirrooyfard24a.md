title: Graph Partitioning with a Move Budget
abstract: In many real world networks, there already exists a (not necessarily optimal)
  $k$-partitioning of the network. Oftentimes, for such networks, one aims to find
  a $k$-partitioning with a smaller cut value by moving only a few nodes across partitions.
  The number of nodes that can be moved across partitions is often a constraint forced
  by budgetary limitations. Motivated by such real-world applications, we introduce
  and study the $r$-move $k$-partitioning problem, a natural variant of the Multiway
  cut problem. Given a graph, a set of $k$ terminals and an initial partitioning of
  the graph, the $r$-move $k$-partitioning problem aims to find a $k$-partitioning
  with the minimum-weighted cut among all the $k$-partitionings that can be obtained
  by moving at most $r$ non-terminal nodes to partitions different from their initial
  ones. Our main result is a polynomial time $3(r+1)$ approximation algorithm for
  this problem. We further show that this problem is $W[1]$-hard, and give an FPTAS
  for when $r$ is a small constant.
