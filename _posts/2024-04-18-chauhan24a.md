title: Dynamic Inter-treatment Information Sharing for Individualized Treatment Effects
  Estimation
software: https://github.com/jmdvinodjmd/HyperITE
abstract: Estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITE) from observational
  studies is a fundamental problem in causal inference and holds significant importance
  across domains, including healthcare. However, limited observational datasets pose
  challenges in reliable ITE estimation as data have to be split among treatment groups
  to train an ITE learner. While information sharing among treatment groups can partially
  alleviate the problem, there is currently no general framework for end-to-end information
  sharing in ITE estimation. To tackle this problem, we propose a deep learning framework
  based on ‘\textit{soft weight sharing}’ to train ITE learners, enabling \textit{dynamic
  end-to-end} information sharing among treatment groups. The proposed framework complements
  existing ITE learners, and introduces a new class of ITE learners, referred to as
  \textit{HyperITE}. We extend state-of-the-art ITE learners with \textit{HyperITE}
  versions and evaluate them on IHDP, ACIC-2016, and Twins benchmarks. Our experimental
  results show that the proposed framework improves ITE estimation error, with increasing
  effectiveness for smaller datasets.
