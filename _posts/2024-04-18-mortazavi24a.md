title: 'On the price of exact truthfulness in incentive-compatible online learning
  with bandit feedback: a regret lower bound for WSU-UX'
abstract: In one view of the classical game of prediction with expert advice with
  binary outcomes, in each round, each expert maintains an adversarially chosen belief
  and honestly reports this belief. We consider a recently introduced, strategic variant
  of this problem with selfish (reputation-seeking) experts, where each expert strategically
  reports in order to maximize their expected future reputation based on their belief.
  In this work, our goal is to design an algorithm for the selfish experts problem
  that is incentive-compatible (IC, or \emph{truthful}), meaning each expertâ€™s best
  strategy is to report truthfully, while also ensuring the algorithm enjoys sublinear
  regret with respect to the expert with the best belief. Freeman et al. (2020) recently
  studied this problem in the full information and bandit settings and obtained truthful,
  no-regret algorithms by leveraging prior work on wagering mechanisms. While their
  results under full information match the minimax rate for the classical ("honest
  experts") problem, the best-known regret for their bandit algorithm WSU-UX is $O(T^{2/3})$,
  which does not match the minimax rate for the classical ("honest bandits") setting.
  It was unclear whether the higher regret was an artifact of their analysis or a
  limitation of WSU-UX. We show, via explicit construction of loss sequences, that
  the algorithm suffers a worst-case $\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound. Left open is the
  possibility that a different IC algorithm obtains $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret. Yet, WSU-UX
  was a natural choice for such an algorithm owing to the limited design room for
  IC algorithms in this setting.
