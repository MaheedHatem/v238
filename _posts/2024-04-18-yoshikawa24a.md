title: Explanation-based Training with Differentiable Insertion/Deletion Metric-aware
  Regularizers
software: https://github.com/yuyay/idexpo
abstract: The quality of explanations for the predictions made by complex machine
  learning predictors is often measured using insertion and deletion metrics, which
  assess the faithfulness of the explanations, i.e., how accurately the explanations
  reflect the predictorâ€™s behavior. To improve the faithfulness, we propose insertion/deletion
  metric-aware explanation-based optimization (ID-ExpO), which optimizes differentiable
  predictors to improve both the insertion and deletion scores of the explanations
  while maintaining their predictive accuracy. Because the original insertion and
  deletion metrics are non-differentiable with respect to the explanations and directly
  unavailable for gradient-based optimization, we extend the metrics so that they
  are differentiable and use them to formalize insertion and deletion metric-based
  regularizers. Our experimental results on image and tabular datasets show that the
  deep neural network-based predictors that are fine-tuned using ID-ExpO enable popular
  post-hoc explainers to produce more faithful and easier-to-interpret explanations
  while maintaining high predictive accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/yuyay/idexpo.
