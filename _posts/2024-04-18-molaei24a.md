  Temporal Graph Attention Networks

abstract: The proliferation of decentralised electronic healthcare records (EHRs)
  across medical institutions requires innovative federated learning strategies for
  collaborative data analysis and global model training, prioritising data privacy.
  A prevalent issue during decentralised model training is the data-view discrepancies
  across medical institutions that arises from differences or availability of healthcare
  services, such as blood test panels. The prevailing way to handle this issue is
  to select a common subset of features across institutions to make data-views consistent.
  This approach, however, constrains some institutions to shed some critical features
  that may play a significant role in improving the model performance. This paper
  introduces a federated learning framework that relies on augmented graph attention
  networks to address data-view heterogeneity. The proposed framework utilises an
  alignment augmentation layer over self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance
  of neighbouring nodes when updating a node’s embedding irrespective of the data-views.
  Furthermore, our framework adeptly addresses both the temporal nuances and structural
  intricacies of EHR datasets. This dual capability not only offers deeper insights
  but also effectively encapsulates EHR graphs’ time-evolving nature. Using diverse
  real-world datasets, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
  conventional FL methodology for dealing with heterogeneous data-views.
