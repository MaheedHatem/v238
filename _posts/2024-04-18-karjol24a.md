title: A Unified Framework for Discovering Discrete Symmetries
software: https://github.com/RohanVKashyap/A-Unified-Framework-for-Discovering-Discrete-Symmetries
abstract: We consider the problem of learning a function respecting a symmetry from
  among a class of symmetries. We develop a unified framework that enables symmetry
  discovery across a broad range of subgroups including locally symmetric, dihedral
  and cyclic subgroups. At the core of the framework is a novel architecture composed
  of linear, matrix-valued and non-linear functions that expresses functions invariant
  to these subgroups in a principled manner. The structure of the architecture enables
  us to leverage multi-armed bandit algorithms and gradient descent to efficiently
  optimize over the linear and the non-linear functions, respectively, and to infer
  the symmetry that is ultimately learnt. We also discuss the necessity of the matrix-valued
  functions in the architecture. Experiments on image-digit sum and polynomial regression
  tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
