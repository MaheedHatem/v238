title: A Cubic-regularized Policy Newton Algorithm for Reinforcement Learning
abstract: We consider the problem of control in the setting of reinforcement learning
  (RL), where model information is not available. Policy gradient algorithms are a
  popular solution approach for this problem and are usually shown to converge to
  a stationary point of the value function. In this paper, we propose two policy Newton
  algorithms that incorporate cubic regularization. Both algorithms employ the likelihood
  ratio method to form estimates of the gradient and Hessian of the value function
  using sample trajectories. The first algorithm requires an exact solution of the
  cubic regularized problem in each iteration, while the second algorithm employs
  an efficient gradient descent-based approximation to the cubic regularized problem.
  We establish convergence of our proposed algorithms to a second-order stationary
  point (SOSP) of the value function, which results in the avoidance of traps in the
  form of saddle points. In particular, the sample complexity of our algorithms to
  find an $\epsilon$-SOSP is $O(\epsilon^{-3.5})$, which is an improvement over the
  state-of-the-art sample complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-4.5})$.
