title: 'Solving General Noisy Inverse Problem via Posterior Sampling: A Policy Gradient
  Viewpoint'
software: https://github.com/loveisbasa/DPG
abstract: Solving image inverse problems (e.g., super-resolution and inpainting) requires
  generating a high fidelity image that matches the given input (the low-resolution
  image or the masked image). By using the input image as guidance, we can leverage
  a pretrained diffusion generative model to solve a wide range of image inverse tasks
  without task specific model fine-tuning. To precisely estimate the guidance score
  function of the input image, we propose Diffusion Policy Gradient (DPG), a tractable
  computation method by viewing the intermediate noisy images as policies and the
  target image as the states selected by the policy. Experiments show that our method
  is robust to both Gaussian and Poisson noise degradation on multiple linear and
  non-linear inverse tasks, resulting into a higher image restoration quality on FFHQ,
  ImageNet and LSUN datasets.
