title: MMD-based Variable Importance for Distributional Random Forest
software: https://github.com/JeffNaef/DRFvarimportance
abstract: Distributional Random Forest (DRF) is a flexible forest-based method to
  estimate the full conditional distribution of a multivariate output of interest
  given input variables. In this article, we introduce a variable importance algorithm
  for DRFs, based on the well-established drop and relearn principle and MMD distance.
  While traditional importance measures only detect variables with an influence on
  the output mean, our algorithm detects variables impacting the output distribution
  more generally. We show that the introduced importance measure is consistent, exhibits
  high empirical performance on both real and simulated data, and outperforms competitors.
  In particular, our algorithm is highly efficient to select variables through recursive
  feature elimination, and can therefore provide small sets of variables to build
  accurate estimates of conditional output distributions.
