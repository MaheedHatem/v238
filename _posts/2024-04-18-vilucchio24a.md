title: Asymptotic Characterisation of the Performance of Robust Linear Regression
  in the Presence of Outliers
software: https://github.com/IdePHICS/RobustRegression
abstract: 'We study robust linear regression in high-dimension, when both the dimension
  $d$ and the number of data points $n$ diverge with a fixed ratio $\alpha=n/d$, and
  study a data model that includes outliers. We provide exact asymptotics for the
  performances of the empirical risk minimisation (ERM) using $\ell_2$-regularised
  $\ell_2$, $\ell_1$, and Huber losses, which are the standard approach to such problems.
  We focus on two metrics for the performance: the generalisation error to similar
  datasets with outliers, and the estimation error of the original, unpolluted function.
  Our results are compared with the information theoretic Bayes-optimal estimation
  bound. For the generalization error, we find that optimally-regularised ERM is asymptotically
  consistent in the large sample complexity limit if one perform a simple calibration,
  and compute the rates of convergence. For the estimation error however, we show
  that due to a norm calibration mismatch, the consistency of the estimator requires
  an oracle estimate of the optimal norm, or the presence of a cross-validation set
  not corrupted by the outliers. We examine in detail how performance depends on the
  loss function and on the degree of outlier corruption in the training set and identify
  a region of parameters where the optimal performance of the Huber loss is identical
  to that of the $\ell_2$ loss, offering insights into the use cases of different
  loss functions.'
