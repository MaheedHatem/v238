title: Optimal Transport for Measures with Noisy Tree Metric
software: https://github.com/lttam/RobustOT-NoisyTreeMetric
abstract: We study optimal transport (OT) problem for probability measures supported
  on a tree metric space. It is known that such OT problem (i.e., tree-Wasserstein
  (TW)) admits a closed-form expression, but depends fundamentally on the underlying
  tree structure over supports of input measures. In practice, the given tree structure
  may be, however, perturbed due to noisy or adversarial measurements. To mitigate
  this issue, we follow the max-min robust OT approach which considers the maximal
  possible distances between two input measures over an uncertainty set of tree metrics.
  In general, this approach is hard to compute, even for measures supported in one-dimensional
  space, due to its non-convexity and non-smoothness which hinders its practical applications,
  especially for large-scale settings. In this work, we propose novel uncertainty
  sets of tree metrics from the lens of edge deletion/addition which covers a diversity
  of tree structures in an elegant framework. Consequently, by building upon the proposed
  uncertainty sets, and leveraging the tree structure over supports, we show that
  the robust OT also admits a closed-form expression for a fast computation as its
  counterpart standard OT (i.e., TW). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the robust
  OT satisfies the metric property and is negative definite. We then exploit its negative
  definiteness to propose positive definite kernels and test them in several simulations
  on various real-world datasets on document classification and topological data analysis.
