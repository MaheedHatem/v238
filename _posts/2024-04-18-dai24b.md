title: Can Probabilistic Feedback Drive User Impacts in Online Platforms?
abstract: 'A common explanation for negative user impacts of content recommender systems
  is misalignment between the platform’s objective and user welfare. In this work,
  we show that misalignment in the platform’s objective is not the only potential
  cause of unintended impacts on users: even when the platform’s objective is fully
  aligned with user welfare, the platform’s learning algorithm can induce negative
  downstream impacts on users. The source of these user impacts is that different
  pieces of content may generate observable user reactions (feedback information)
  at different rates; these feedback rates may correlate with content properties,
  such as controversiality or demographic similarity of the creator, that affect the
  user experience. Since differences in feedback rates can impact how often the learning
  algorithm engages with different content, the learning algorithm may inadvertently
  promote content with certain such properties. Using the multi-armed bandit framework
  with probabilistic feedback, we examine the relationship between feedback rates
  and a learning algorithm’s engagement with individual arms for different no-regret
  algorithms. We prove that no-regret algorithms can exhibit a wide range of dependencies:
  if the feedback rate of an arm increases, some no-regret algorithms engage with
  the arm more, some no-regret algorithms engage with the arm less, and other no-regret
  algorithms engage with the arm approximately the same number of times. From a platform
  design perspective, our results highlight the importance of looking beyond regret
  when measuring an algorithm’s performance, and assessing the nature of a learning
  algorithm’s engagement with different types of content as well as their resulting
  downstream impacts.'
