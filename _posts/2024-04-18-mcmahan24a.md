title: Anytime-Constrained Reinforcement Learning
software: https://github.com/jermcmahan/anytime-constraints.git
abstract: We introduce and study constrained Markov Decision Processes (cMDPs) with
  anytime constraints. An anytime constraint requires the agent to never violate its
  budget at any point in time, almost surely. Although Markovian policies are no longer
  sufficient, we show that there exist optimal deterministic policies augmented with
  cumulative costs. In fact, we present a fixed-parameter tractable reduction from
  anytime-constrained cMDPs to unconstrained MDPs. Our reduction yields planning and
  learning algorithms that are time and sample-efficient for tabular cMDPs so long
  as the precision of the costs is logarithmic in the size of the cMDP. However, we
  also show that computing non-trivial approximately optimal policies is NP-hard in
  general. To circumvent this bottleneck, we design provable approximation algorithms
  that efficiently compute or learn an arbitrarily accurate approximately feasible
  policy with optimal value so long as the maximum supported cost is bounded by a
  polynomial in the cMDP or the absolute budget. Given our hardness results, our approximation
  guarantees are the best possible under worst-case analysis.
