title: Generative Flow Networks as Entropy-Regularized RL
software: https://github.com/d-tiapkin/gflownet-rl
abstract: The recently proposed generative flow networks (GFlowNets) are a method
  of training a policy to sample compositional discrete objects with probabilities
  proportional to a given reward via a sequence of actions. GFlowNets exploit the
  sequential nature of the problem, drawing parallels with reinforcement learning
  (RL). Our work extends the connection between RL and GFlowNets to a general case.
  We demonstrate how the task of learning a generative flow network can be efficiently
  redefined as an entropy-regularized RL problem with a specific reward and regularizer
  structure. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical efficiency of this reformulation
  by applying standard soft RL algorithms to GFlowNet training across several probabilistic
  modeling tasks. Contrary to previously reported results, we show that entropic RL
  approaches can be competitive against established GFlowNet training methods. This
  perspective opens a direct path for integrating RL principles into the realm of
  generative flow networks.
