title: Enhancing In-context Learning via Linear Probe Calibration
software: https://github.com/mominabbass/LinC
abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is a new paradigm for natural language processing
  that utilizes Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-like models. This approach
  uses prompts that include in-context demonstrations to generate the corresponding
  output for a new query input. However, applying ICL in real cases does not scale
  with the number of samples, and lacks robustness to different prompt templates and
  demonstration permutations. In this paper, we first show that GPT-like models using
  ICL result in unreliable predictions based on a new metric based on Shannon entropy.
  Then, to solve this problem, we propose a new technique called the Linear Probe
  Calibration (LinC), a method that calibrates the modelâ€™s output probabilities, resulting
  in reliable predictions and improved performance, while requiring only minimal additional
  samples (as few as five labeled data samples). LinC significantly enhances the ICL
  test performance of GPT models on various benchmark datasets, with an average improvement
  of up to 21%, and up to a 50% improvement in some cases, and significantly boosts
  the performance of PEFT methods, especially in the low resource regime. Moreover,
  LinC achieves lower expected calibration error, and is highly robust to varying
  label proportions, prompt templates, and demonstration permutations.
