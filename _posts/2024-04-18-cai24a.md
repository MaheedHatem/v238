title: Near-Optimal Policy Optimization for Correlated Equilibrium in General-Sum
  Markov Games
abstract: We study policy optimization algorithms for computing correlated equilibria
  in multi-player general-sum Markov Games. Previous results achieve $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/2})$
  convergence rate to a correlated equilibrium and an accelerated $\tilde{O}(T^{-3/4})$
  convergence rate to the weaker notion of coarse correlated equilibrium. In this
  paper, we improve both results significantly by providing an uncoupled policy optimization
  algorithm that attains a near-optimal $\tilde{O}(T^{-1})$ convergence rate for computing
  a correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm is constructed by combining two main elements
  (i) smooth value updates and (ii) the \emph{optimistic-follow-the-regularized-leader}
  algorithm with the log barrier regularizer.
