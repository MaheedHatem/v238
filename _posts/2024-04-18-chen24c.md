abstract: Experiment design has a rich history dating back over a century and has
  found many critical applications across various fields since then. The use and collection
  of users’ data in experiments often involve sensitive personal information, so additional
  measures to protect individual privacy are required during data collection, storage,
  and usage. In this work, we focus on the rigorous protection of users’ privacy (under
  the notion of differential privacy (DP)) while minimizing the trust toward service
  providers. Specifically, we consider the estimation of the average treatment effect
  (ATE) under DP, while only allowing the analyst to collect population-level statistics
  via secure aggregation, a distributed protocol enabling a service provider to aggregate
  information without accessing individual data. Although a vital component in modern
  A/B testing workflows, private distributed experimentation has not previously been
  studied. To achieve DP, we design local privatization mechanisms that are compatible
  with secure aggregation and analyze the utility, in terms of the width of confidence
  intervals, both asymptotically and non-asymptotically. We show how these mechanisms
  can be scaled up to handle the very large number of participants commonly found
  in practice. In addition, when introducing DP noise, it is imperative to cleverly
  split privacy budgets to estimate both the mean and variance of the outcomes and
  carefully calibrate the confidence intervals according to the DP noise. Last, we
  present comprehensive experimental evaluations of our proposed schemes and show
  the privacy-utility trade-offs in experiment design.
