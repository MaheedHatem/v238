title: 'Timing as an Action: Learning When to Observe and Act'
software: https://github.com/hlzhou/Timing-as-an-Action
abstract: In standard reinforcement learning setups, the agent receives observations
  and performs actions at evenly spaced intervals. However, in many real-world settings,
  observations are expensive, forcing agents to commit to courses of action for designated
  periods of time. Consider that doctors, after each visit, typically set not only
  a treatment plan but also a follow-up date at which that plan might be revised.
  In this work, we formalize the setup of timing-as-an-action. Through theoretical
  analysis in the tabular setting, we show that while the choice of delay intervals
  could be naively folded in as part of a composite action, these actions have a special
  structure and handling them intelligently yields statistical advantages. Taking
  a model-based perspective, these gains owe to the fact that delay actions do not
  add any parameters to the underlying model. For model estimation, we provide provable
  sample-efficiency improvements, and our experiments demonstrate empirical improvements
  in both healthcare simulators and classical reinforcement learning environments.
