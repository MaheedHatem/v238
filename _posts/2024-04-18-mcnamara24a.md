title: Sequential Monte Carlo for Inclusive KL Minimization in Amortized Variational
  Inference
software: https://github.com/declanmcnamara/smc-wake
abstract: For training an encoder network to perform amortized variational inference,
  the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the exact posterior to its approximation,
  known as the inclusive or forward KL, is an increasingly popular choice of variational
  objective due to the mass-covering property of its minimizer. However, minimizing
  this objective is challenging. A popular existing approach, Reweighted Wake-Sleep
  (RWS), suffers from heavily biased gradients and a circular pathology that results
  in highly concentrated variational distributions. As an alternative, we propose
  SMC-Wake, a procedure for fitting an amortized variational approximation that uses
  likelihood-tempered sequential Monte Carlo samplers to estimate the gradient of
  the inclusive KL divergence. We propose three gradient estimators, all of which
  are asymptotically unbiased in the number of iterations and two of which are strongly
  consistent. Our method interleaves stochastic gradient updates, SMC samplers, and
  iterative improvement to an estimate of the normalizing constant to reduce bias
  from self-normalization. In experiments with both simulated and real datasets, SMC-Wake
  fits variational distributions that approximate the posterior more accurately than
  existing methods.
