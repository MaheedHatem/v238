title: A/B testing under Interference with Partial Network Information
software: https://github.com/Information-Fusion-Lab-Umass/unite
abstract: 'A/B tests are often required to be conducted on subjects that might have
  social connections. For e.g., experiments on social media, or medical and social
  interventions to control the spread of an epidemic. In such settings, the SUTVA
  assumption for randomized-controlled trials is violated due to network interference,
  or spill-over effects, as treatments to group A can potentially also affect the
  control group B. When the underlying social network is known exactly, prior works
  have demonstrated how to conduct A/B tests adequately to estimate the global average
  treatment effect (GATE). However, in practice, it is often impossible to obtain
  knowledge about the exact underlying network. In this paper, we present UNITE: a
  novel estimator that relax this assumption and can identify GATE while only relying
  on knowledge of the superset of neighbors for any subject in the graph. Through
  theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, we show that the proposed approach
  performs better in comparison to standard estimators.'
