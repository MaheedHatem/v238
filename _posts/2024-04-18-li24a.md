title: Personalized Federated X-armed Bandit
abstract: In this work, we study the personalized federated $\mathcal{X}$-armed bandit
  problem, where the heterogeneous local objectives of the clients are optimized simultaneously
  in the federated learning paradigm. We propose the \texttt{PF-PNE} algorithm with
  a unique double elimination strategy, which safely eliminates the non-optimal regions
  while encouraging federated collaboration through biased but effective evaluations
  of the local objectives. The proposed \texttt{PF-PNE} algorithm is able to optimize
  local objectives with arbitrary levels of heterogeneity, and its limited communications
  protects the confidentiality of the client-wise reward data. Our theoretical analysis
  shows the benefit of the proposed algorithm over single-client algorithms. Experimentally,
  \texttt{PF-PNE} outperforms multiple baselines on both synthetic and real life datasets.
