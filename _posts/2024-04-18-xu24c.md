title: 'BLIS-Net: Classifying and Analyzing Signals on Graphs'
software: https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/blis
abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for tasks such
  as node classification and graph classification. However, much less work has been
  done on signal classification, where the data consists of many functions (referred
  to as signals) defined on the vertices of a single graph. These tasks require networks
  designed differently from those designed for traditional GNN tasks. Indeed, traditional
  GNNs rely on localized low-pass filters, and signals of interest may have intricate
  multi-frequency behavior and exhibit long range interactions. This motivates us
  to introduce the BLIS-Net (Bi-Lipschitz Scattering Net), a novel GNN that builds
  on the previously introduced geometric scattering transform. Our network is able
  to capture both local and global signal structure and is able to capture both low-frequency
  and high-frequency information. We make several crucial changes to the original
  geometric scattering architecture which we prove increase the ability of our network
  to capture information about the input signal and show that BLIS-Net achieves superior
  performance on both synthetic and real-world data sets based on traffic flow and
  fMRI data.
