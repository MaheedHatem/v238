title: Efficient Variational Sequential Information Control
software: https://github.com/sjwjames/greedy_info_control
abstract: We develop a family of fast variational methods for sequential control in
  dynamic settings where an agent is incentivized to maximize information gain. We
  consider the case of optimal control in continuous nonlinear dynamical systems that
  prohibit exact evaluation of the mutual information (MI) reward. Our approach couples
  efficient message-passing inference with variational bounds on the MI objective
  under Gaussian projections. We also develop a Gaussian mixture approximation that
  enables exact MI evaluation under constraints on the component covariances. We validate
  our methodology in nonlinear systems with superior and faster control compared to
  standard particle-based methods. We show our approach improves the accuracy and
  efficiency of one-shot robotic learning with intrinsic MI rewards. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate that our method is applicable to a wider range of contexts, e.g.,
  the active information acquisition problem.
