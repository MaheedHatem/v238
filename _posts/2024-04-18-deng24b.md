title: On the Generalization Ability of Unsupervised Pretraining
abstract: 'Recent advances in unsupervised learning have shown that unsupervised pre-training,
  followed by fine-tuning, can improve model generalization. However, a rigorous understanding
  of how the representation function learned on an unlabeled dataset affects the generalization
  of the fine-tuned model is lacking. Existing theoretical research does not adequately
  account for the heterogeneity of the distribution and tasks in pre-training and
  fine-tuning stage. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel theoretical
  framework that illuminates the critical factor influencing the transferability of
  knowledge acquired during unsupervised pre-training to the subsequent fine-tuning
  phase, ultimately affecting the generalization capabilities of the fine-tuned model
  on downstream tasks. We apply our theoretical framework to analyze generalization
  bound of two distinct scenarios: Context Encoder pre-training with deep neural networks
  and Masked Autoencoder pre-training with deep transformers, followed by fine-tuning
  on a binary classification task. Finally, inspired by our findings, we propose a
  novel regularization method during pre-training to further enhances the generalization
  of fine-tuned model. Overall, our results contribute to a better understanding of
  unsupervised pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, and can shed light on the design
  of more effective pre-training algorithms.'
