title: Fairness in Submodular Maximization over a Matroid Constraint
abstract: Submodular maximization over a matroid constraint is a fundamental problem
  with various applications in machine learning. Some of these applications involve
  decision-making over datapoints with sensitive attributes such as gender or race.
  In such settings, it is crucial to guarantee that the selected solution is fairly
  distributed with respect to this attribute. Recently, fairness has been investigated
  in submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint in both the streaming
  and offline settings, however the more general problem with matroid constraint has
  only been considered in the streaming setting and only for monotone objectives.
  This work fills this gap. We propose various algorithms and impossibility results
  offering different trade-offs between quality, fairness, and generality.
