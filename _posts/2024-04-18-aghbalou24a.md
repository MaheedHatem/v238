title: 'Sharp error bounds for imbalanced classification: how many examples in the
  minority class?'
abstract: 'When dealing with imbalanced classification data, reweighting the loss
  function is a standard procedure allowing to equilibrate between the true positive
  and true negative rates within the risk measure. Despite significant theoretical
  work in this area, existing results do not adequately address a main challenge within
  the imbalanced classification framework, which is the negligible size of one class
  in relation to the full sample size and the need to rescale the risk function by
  a probability tending to zero. To address this gap, we present two novel contributions
  in the setting where the rare class probability approaches zero: (1) a non asymptotic
  fast rate probability bound for constrained balanced empirical risk minimization,
  and (2) a consistent upper bound for balanced nearest neighbors estimates. Our findings
  provide a clearer understanding of the benefits of class-weighting in realistic
  settings, opening new avenues for further research in this field.'
