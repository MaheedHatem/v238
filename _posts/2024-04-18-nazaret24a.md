title: On the Misspecification of Linear Assumptions in Synthetic Controls
software: https://github.com/blei-lab/synthetic_controls
abstract: 'The synthetic control (SC) method is popular for estimating causal effects
  from observational panel data. It rests on a crucial assumption that we can write
  the treated unit as a linear combination of the untreated units. In practice, this
  assumption may not hold, and when violated, the resulting SC estimates are incorrect.
  This paper examines two questions: (1) How large can the misspecification error
  be? (2) How can we minimize it? First, we provide theoretical bounds to quantify
  the misspecification error. The bounds are comforting: small misspecifications induce
  small errors. With these bounds in hand, we develop new SC estimators specially
  designed to minimize misspecification error. The estimators are based on additional
  data about each unit. (E.g., if the units are countries, it might be demographic
  information about each.) We study our estimators on synthetic data; we find they
  produce more accurate causal estimates than standard SC. We then re-analyze the
  California tobacco program data of the original SC paper, now including additional
  data from the US census about per-state demographics. Our estimators show that the
  observations in the pre-treatment period lie within the bounds of misspecification
  error and that observations post-treatment lie outside of those bounds. This is
  evidence that our SC methods have uncovered a true effect.'
