title: Proxy Methods for Domain Adaptation
software: https://github.com/koyejo-lab/ProxyDA
abstract: 'We study the problem of domain adaptation under distribution shift, where
  the shift is due to a change in the distribution of an unobserved, latent variable
  that confounds both the covariates and the labels. In this setting, neither the
  covariate shift nor the label shift assumptions apply. Our approach to adaptation
  employs proximal causal learning, a technique for estimating causal effects in settings
  where proxies of unobserved confounders are available. We demonstrate that proxy
  variables allow for adaptation to distribution shift without explicitly recovering
  or modeling latent variables. We consider two settings, (i) Concept Bottleneck:
  an additional “concept” variable is observed that mediates the relationship between
  the covariates and labels; (ii) Multi-domain: training data from multiple source
  domains is available, where each source domain exhibits a different distribution
  over the latent confounder. We develop a two-stage kernel estimation approach to
  adapt to complex distribution shifts in both settings. In our experiments, we show
  that our approach outperforms other methods, notably those which explicitly recover
  the latent confounder.'
