title: On the Vulnerability of Fairness Constrained Learning to Malicious Noise
abstract: We consider the vulnerability of fairness-constrained learning to small
  amounts of malicious noise in the training data. [Konstantinov and Lampert, 2021]
  initiated the study of this question and presented negative results showing there
  exist data distributions where for several fairness constraints, any proper learner
  will exhibit high vulnerability when group sizes are imbalanced. Here, we present
  a more optimistic view, showing that if we allow randomized classifiers, then the
  landscape is much more nuanced. For example, for Demographic Parity we show we can
  incur only a $\Theta(\alpha)$ loss in accuracy, where $\alpha$ is the malicious
  noise rate, matching the best possible even without fairness constraints. For Equal
  Opportunity, we show we can incur an $O(\sqrt{\alpha})$ loss, and give a matching
  $\Omega(\sqrt{\alpha})$ lower bound. In contrast, [Konstantinov and Lampert, 2021]
  showed for proper learners the loss in accuracy for both notions is $\Omega(1)$.
  The key technical novelty of our work is how randomization can bypass simple "tricks"
  an adversary can use to amplify his power. We also consider additional fairness
  notions including Equalized Odds and Calibration. For these fairness notions, the
  excess accuracy clusters into three natural regimes $O(\alpha)$, $O(\sqrt{\alpha})$,
  and $O(1)$. These results provide a more fine-grained view of the sensitivity of
  fairness-constrained learning to adversarial noise in training data.
