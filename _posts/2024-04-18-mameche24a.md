title: Identifying Confounding from Causal Mechanism Shifts
software: https://github.com/srhmm/coco/
abstract: Causal discovery methods commonly assume that all data is independently
  and identically distributed (i.i.d.) and that there are no unmeasured confounding
  variables. In practice, neither is likely to hold, and detecting confounding in
  non-i.i.d. settings poses a significant challenge. Motivated by this, we explore
  how to discover confounders from data in multiple environments with causal mechanism
  shifts. We show that the mechanism changes of observed variables can reveal which
  variable sets are confounded. Based on this idea, we propose an empirically testable
  criterion based on mutual information, show under which conditions it can identify
  confounding, and introduce CoCo to discover confounders from data in multiple contexts.
  In our experiments, we show that CoCo works well on synthetic and real-world data.
