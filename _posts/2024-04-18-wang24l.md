title: 'Near-Interpolators: Rapid Norm Growth and the Trade-Off between Interpolation
  and Generalization'
software: https://github.com/YutongWangUMich/Near-Interpolators-Figures
abstract: 'We study the generalization capability of nearly-interpolating linear regressors:
  ${\beta}$â€™s whose training error $\tau$ is positive but small, i.e., below the noise
  floor. Under a random matrix theoretic assumption on the data distribution and an
  eigendecay assumption on the data covariance matrix ${\Sigma}$, we demonstrate that
  any near-interpolator exhibits rapid norm growth: for $\tau$ fixed, ${\beta}$ has
  squared $\ell_2$-norm $\mathbb{E}[\|{{\beta}}\|_{2}^{2}] = \Omega(n^{\alpha})$ where
  $n$ is the number of samples and $\alpha >1$ is the exponent of the eigendecay,
  i.e., $\lambda_i({\Sigma}) \sim i^{-\alpha}$. This implies that existing data-independent
  norm-based bounds are necessarily loose. On the other hand, in the same regime we
  precisely characterize the asymptotic trade-off between interpolation and generalization.
  Our characterization reveals that larger norm scaling exponents $\alpha$ correspond
  to worse trade-offs between interpolation and generalization. We verify empirically
  that a similar phenomenon holds for nearly-interpolating shallow neural networks.'
