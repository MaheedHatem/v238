title: Optimal Zero-Shot Detector for Multi-Armed Attacks
software: https://github.com/fgranese/Optimal-Zero-Shot-Detector-for-Multi-Armed-Attacks
abstract: This research delves into a scenario where a malicious actor can manipulate
  data samples using a multi-armed attack strategy, providing them with multiple ways
  to introduce noise into the data sample. Our central objective is to protect the
  data by detecting any alterations to the input. We approach this defensive strategy
  with utmost caution, operating in an environment where the defender possesses significantly
  less information compared to the attacker. Specifically, the defender is unable
  to utilize any data samples for training a defense model or verifying the integrity
  of the channel. Instead, the defender relies exclusively on a set of pre-existing
  detectors readily available "off the shelf." To tackle this challenge, we derive
  an innovative information-theoretic defense approach that optimally aggregates the
  decisions made by these detectors, eliminating the need for any training data. We
  further explore a practical use-case scenario for empirical evaluation, where the
  attacker possesses a pre-trained classifier and launches well-known adversarial
  attacks against it. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of our proposed
  solution, even in scenarios that deviate from the optimal setup.
