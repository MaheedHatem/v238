title: Scalable Algorithms for Individual Preference Stable Clustering
abstract: In this paper, we study the individual preference (IP) stability, which
  is an notion capturing individual fairness and stability in clustering. Within this
  setting, a clustering is $\alpha$-IP stable when each data pointâ€™s average distance
  to its cluster is no more than $\alpha$ times its average distance to any other
  cluster. In this paper, we study the natural local search algorithm for IP stable
  clustering. Our analysis confirms a $O(\log n)$-IP stability guarantee for this
  algorithm, where $n$ denotes the number of points in the input. Furthermore, by
  refining the local search approach, we show it runs in an almost linear time, $\tilde{O}(nk)$.
