title: Simulation-Free Schrödinger Bridges via Score and Flow Matching
software: https://github.com/atong01/conditional-flow-matching
abstract: We present simulation-free score and flow matching ([SF]$^2$M), a simulation-free
  objective for inferring stochastic dynamics given unpaired samples drawn from arbitrary
  source and target distributions. Our method generalizes both the score-matching
  loss used in the training of diffusion models and the recently proposed flow matching
  loss used in the training of continuous normalizing flows. [SF]$^2$M interprets
  continuous-time stochastic generative modeling as a Schrödinger bridge problem.
  It relies on static entropy-regularized optimal transport, or a minibatch approximation,
  to efficiently learn the SB without simulating the learned stochastic process. We
  find that [SF]$^2$M is more efficient and gives more accurate solutions to the SB
  problem than simulation-based methods from prior work. Finally, we apply [SF]$^2$M
  to the problem of learning cell dynamics from snapshot data. Notably, [SF]$^2$M
  is the first method to accurately model cell dynamics in high dimensions and can
  recover known gene regulatory networks from simulated data. Our code is available
  in the TorchCFM package at \url{https://github.com/atong01/conditional-flow-matching}.
