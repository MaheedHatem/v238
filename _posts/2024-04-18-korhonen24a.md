title: Structural perspective on constraint-based learning of Markov networks
abstract: 'Markov networks are probabilistic graphical models that employ undirected
  graphs to depict conditional independence relationships among variables. Our focus
  lies in constraint-based structure learning, which entails learning the undirected
  graph from data through the execution of conditional independence tests. We establish
  theoretical limits concerning two critical aspects of constraint-based learning
  of Markov networks: the number of tests and the sizes of the conditioning sets.
  These bounds uncover an exciting interplay between the structural properties of
  the graph and the amount of tests required to learn a Markov network. The starting
  point of our work is that the graph parameter maximum pairwise connectivity, $\kappa$,
  that is, the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths connecting a pair of vertices
  in the graph, is responsible for the sizes of independence tests required to learn
  the graph. On one hand, we show that at least one test with the size of the conditioning
  set at least $\kappa$ is always necessary. On the other hand, we prove that any
  graph can be learned by performing tests of size at most $\kappa$. This completely
  resolves the question of the minimum size of conditioning sets required to learn
  the graph. When it comes to the number of tests, our upper bound on the sizes of
  conditioning sets implies that every $n$-vertex graph can be learned by at most
  $n^{\kappa}$ tests with conditioning sets of sizes at most $\kappa$. We show that
  for any upper bound q on the sizes of the conditioning sets, there exist graphs
  with $O(nq)$ vertices that require at least $n^{\Omega(\kappa)}$ tests to learn.
  This lower bound holds even when the treewidth and the maximum degree of the graph
  are at most $\kappa+2$. On the positive side, we prove that every graph of bounded
  treewidth can be learned by a polynomial number of tests with conditioning sets
  of sizes at most $2*\kappa$.'
