title: Proximal Causal Inference for Synthetic Control with Surrogates
software: https://github.com/freshtaste/proximal
abstract: The synthetic control method (SCM) has become a popular tool for estimating
  causal effects in policy evaluation, where a single treated unit is observed. However,
  SCM faces challenges in accurately predicting post-intervention potential outcomes
  had, contrary to fact, the treatment been withheld, when the pre-intervention period
  is short or the post-intervention period is long. To address these issues, we propose
  a novel method that leverages post-intervention information, specifically time-varying
  correlates of the causal effect called "surrogates", within the synthetic control
  framework. We establish conditions for identifying model parameters using the proximal
  inference framework and apply the generalized method of moments (GMM) approach for
  estimation and inference about the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).
  Interestingly, we uncover specific conditions under which exclusively using post-intervention
  data suffices for estimation within our framework. Through a synthetic experiment
  and a real-world application, we demonstrate that our method can outperform other
  synthetic control methods in estimating both short-term and long-term effects, yielding
  more accurate inferences.
