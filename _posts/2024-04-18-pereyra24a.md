title: Equivariant bootstrapping for uncertainty quantification in imaging inverse
  problems
software: https://github.com/tachella/equivariant_bootstrap
abstract: Scientific imaging problems are often severely ill-posed and hence have
  significant intrinsic uncertainty. Accurately quantifying the uncertainty in the
  solutions to such problems is therefore critical for the rigorous interpretation
  of experimental results as well as for reliably using the reconstructed images as
  scientific evidence. Unfortunately, existing imaging methods are unable to quantify
  the uncertainty in the reconstructed images in a way that is robust to experiment
  replications. This paper presents a new uncertainty quantification methodology based
  on an equivariant formulation of the parametric bootstrap algorithm that leverages
  symmetries and invariance properties commonly encountered in imaging problems. Additionally,
  the proposed methodology is general and can be easily applied with any image reconstruction
  technique, including unsupervised training strategies that can be trained from observed
  data alone, thus enabling uncertainty quantification in situations where there is
  no ground truth data available. We demonstrate the proposed approach with a series
  of experiments and comparisons with alternative state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification
  strategies. In all our experiments, the proposed equivariant bootstrap delivers
  remarkably accurate high-dimensional confidence regions and outperforms the competing
  approaches in terms of estimation accuracy, uncertainty quantification accuracy,
  and computing time. These empirical findings are supported by a detailed theoretical
  analysis of equivariant bootstrap for linear estimators.
