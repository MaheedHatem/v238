title: Analyzing Explainer Robustness via Probabilistic Lipschitzness of Prediction
  Functions
software: https://github.com/zqkhan/Analyzing_Explainers_Code
abstract: Machine learning methods have significantly improved in their predictive
  capabilities, but at the same time they are becoming more complex and less transparent.
  As a result, explainers are often relied on to provide interpretability to these
  black-box prediction models. As crucial diagnostics tools, it is important that
  these explainers themselves are robust. In this paper we focus on one particular
  aspect of robustness, namely that an explainer should give similar explanations
  for similar data inputs. We formalize this notion by introducing and defining explainer
  astuteness, analogous to astuteness of prediction functions. Our formalism allows
  us to connect explainer robustness to the predictorâ€™s probabilistic Lipschitzness,
  which captures the probability of local smoothness of a function. We provide lower
  bound guarantees on the astuteness of a variety of explainers (e.g., SHAP, RISE,
  CXPlain) given the Lipschitzness of the prediction function. These theoretical results
  imply that locally smooth prediction functions lend themselves to locally robust
  explanations. We evaluate these results empirically on simulated as well as real
  datasets.
