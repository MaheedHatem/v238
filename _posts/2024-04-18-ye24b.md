title: Smoothness-Adaptive Dynamic Pricing with Nonparametric Demand Learning
software: https://github.com/liamyzq/Smoothness-Adaptive-Dynamic-Pricing
abstract: We study the dynamic pricing problem where the demand function is nonparametric
  and Hölder smooth, and we focus on adaptivity to the unknown Hölder smoothness parameter
  $\beta$ of the demand function. Traditionally the optimal dynamic pricing algorithm
  heavily relies on the knowledge of $\beta$ to achieve a minimax optimal regret of
  $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{\beta+1}{2\beta+1}})$. However, we highlight the challenge
  of adaptivity in this dynamic pricing problem by proving that no pricing policy
  can adaptively achieve this minimax optimal regret without knowledge of $\beta$.
  Motivated by the impossibility result, we propose a self-similarity condition to
  enable adaptivity. Importantly, we show that the self-similarity condition does
  not compromise the problem’s inherent complexity since it preserves the regret lower
  bound $\Omega(T^{\frac{\beta+1}{2\beta+1}})$. Furthermore, we develop a smoothness-adaptive
  dynamic pricing algorithm and theoretically prove that the algorithm achieves this
  minimax optimal regret bound without the prior knowledge $\beta$.
