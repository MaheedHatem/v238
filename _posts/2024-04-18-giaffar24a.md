title: The Effective Number of Shared Dimensions Between Paired Datasets
software: https://github.com/hamzagiaffar/ensd.git
abstract: A number of recent studies have sought to understand the behavior of both
  artificial and biological neural networks by comparing representations across layers,
  networks and brain areas. Increasingly prevalent, too, are comparisons across modalities
  of data, such as neural network activations and training data or behavioral data
  and neurophysiological recordings. One approach to such comparisons involves measuring
  the dimensionality of the space shared between the paired data matrices, where dimensionality
  serves as a proxy for computational or representational complexity. Established
  approaches, including CCA, can be used to measure the number of shared embedding
  dimensions, however they do not account for potentially unequal variance along shared
  dimensions and so cannot measure effective shared dimensionality. We present a candidate
  measure for shared dimensionality that we call the effective number of shared dimensions
  (ENSD). The ENSD is an interpretable and computationally efficient model-free measure
  of shared dimensionality that can be used to probe shared structure in a wide variety
  of data types. We demonstrate the relative robustness of the ENSD in cases where
  data is sparse or low rank and illustrate how the ENSD can be applied in a variety
  of analyses of representational similarities across layers in convolutional neural
  networks and between brain regions.
